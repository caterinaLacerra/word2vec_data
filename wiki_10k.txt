The Standard Rex rabbit is a breed of European rabbit ( Oryctolagus cuniculus ) that has developed to have short dense plush velvet-like fur.The Rex is a medium-sized rabbit with a commercial , round body and an ideal weight range of 7.5 -- 10.5 pounds ( 3.4 -- 4.8 kg ) , although females can weigh as much as 10.5 pounds ( 4.8 kg ) .
The Rex has a slightly broader head than other breeds of rabbit , proportionate upright ears , and proportionally smaller feet .
As with most larger breeds , the female ( doe ) has a dewlap , a large flap of skin under the chin .
History and origin The Rex is a variety of rabbit that exhibits plush fur that is often described as having a velvety texture .
The breed originated in France in 1919 .
Its origin was a litter of wild gray rabbits and has been developed over the years by fanciers and the fur industry .
The Rex Rabbit was first shown publicly at the Paris International Rabbit Show in 1924 and has been recognized as a standard breed in parts of Europe since 1925 .
The Rex was first imported to the United States in 1924 following the Paris International Rabbit Show by American rabbit pioneer John C. Fehr and his partner Alfred Zimmerman .
Genetics Many genes contribute to the Standard Rex breed .
The definition of the breed is maintained by ARBA .
The definition is based strictly on phenotype .
The gross external features used identify the rabbit include weight , coloration , coat texture and length .
Of these features , amongst fanciers and the fur industry , the coat properties are of chief concern .
This breed has a low to moderate activity level and can jump as high as three feet .
Fur The word rex ( with a lowercase ' r ' ) refers to the unique characteristics of an animal 's " rexed " fur .
The result of a specific genetic mutation that is now deliberately sought in the Rex rabbit breeds , rex fur lacks the longer guard hairs typical of the more common short-furred animal .
Each hair in a rex coat is evenly short in length and , because of the density of those hairs , rex fur is often described as plush or velvety .
Three varieties of rex fur now exist : standard rex fur , short curly rex fur ( as in the Astrex ) , and long curly rex fur ( as in the Opposum ) .
Varieties The Rex Rabbit is available in many different colors.There are clubs for fanciers of particular rabbits and Standard Rex is no exception .
Modern development Currently , Rex Rabbits are kept as pets , as show rabbits , and for fur and meat production .
The Rex remains the number one breed used in fur production for garments and toys as their fur lacks protruding guard hairs which in other breeds which must be shorn and plucked after the tanning process to resemble other animal furs .
The bulk of furs produced in the United States are more of a by-product to the primary purpose of meat production and are of lesser quality .
Meat production favors harvest of young animals ( 70 -- 84 days ) which is not sufficient time for the rabbit to grow a high quality adult fur .
The fur is best after 6 months and during the coldest part of the year .
The overwhelming number of furs produced in the USA are used in the creation of felt because the fur quality of commercially raised rabbits is of too low a quality for the garment trade .

Subodh Gupta ( born in 1964 ) is an Indian Contemporary artist based in New Delhi .
Trained as a painter , he went on to experiment with a variety of media .
His work encompasses sculpture , installation , painting , photography , performance and video .
He is married to artist Bharti Kher and is represented by Hauser & Wirth and Nature Morte , New Delhi .
He lives and works in Gurugram .
Early life and education Gupta was born one of seven children in Khagaul , in Patna , Bihar .
His father , a railway guard , died in his early forties , when Gupta was 12 .
His mother came from a farming family and sent Gupta to live with her brother for few years in a remote village .
“ Not a single school kid wore shoes , and there is no road to go to school .
Sometimes we stop in the field and we sit down and eat green chickpea 's before we go to school , " he said in an interview with Ginny Dougary for The Times . "
After leaving school , Gupta joined one of the four small theatre groups in Khagaul and worked as an actor for five years .
He also designed posters to advertise the plays , which is when it was first suggested that he go to art college .
He ended up working as a part-time newspaper designer and illustrator while studying at the College of Art , Patna ( from 1983-1988 ) .
The day he was offered a permanent job by the newspaper , he packed it in to try his luck in Delhi , where he was awarded a scholarship by a government-run initiative , and a space to work in the Garhi Studios , " wrote Dougary in her 2009 article " Subodh Gupta , India 's hottest new artist , talks about skulls , milk pails and cow dung . "
Gupta met artist Bharti Kher during his residency at Garhi .
They were soon married and had two children .
Work Gupta is best known for incorporating everyday objects that are ubiquitous throughout India , such as the steel tiffin boxes used by millions to carry their lunch as well as thali pans , bicycles , and milk pails .
From such ordinary items the artist produces sculptures that reflect on the economic transformation of his homeland and which relate to Gupta 's own life and memories .
As Gupta says : ' All these things were part of the way I grew up .
They are used in the rituals and ceremonies that were part of my childhood .
Indians either remember them from their youth , or they want to remember them . '
And : ' I am the idol thief .
I steal from the drama of Hindu life .
And from the kitchen - these pots , they are like stolen gods , smuggled out of the country .
Hindu kitchens are as important as prayer rooms . '
Gupta transforms the icons of Indian everyday life into artworks that are readable globally .
He is among a generation of young Indian artists whose commentary tells of a country on the move , fuelled by boiling economic growth and a more materialistic mindset .
Gupta 's strategy of appropriating everyday objects and turning them into artworks that dissolve their former meaning and function brings him close to artists like Duchamp ; The Guardian called him ' the Damien Hirst of Delhi . '
He succeeds in finding an art language that references India and at the same time can be appreciated for its aesthetic throughout world ; as Gupta says : ' Art language is the same all over the world .
Which allows me to be anywhere . '
One of his recent major works , consisting of Indian cooking utensils , is ' Line of Control ' ( 2008 ) , a colossal mushroom cloud constructed entirely of pots and pans .
The work was shown in the Tate Triennial at Tate Britain in 2009 and is currently exhibited at the Kiran Nadar Museum of Art in Delhi.Painting is also an important part of Subodh Gupta 's art practice .
His series ' Still Steal Steel ' consists of photorealistic paintings of kitchen utensils falling and moving in space .
In his early paintings , Gupta used another element of Indian every day life , cow dung .
This is used in India for building houses and as fuel for cooking fires .
Moreover , it is a cleaning agent .
The idea that cow dung is inherently clean is ingrained in rural India .
There , it is a purifying element , both ritual and symbolic .
In his video ' Pure ' ( 2000 , 9 min . )
, Gupta takes the detergent concept literally and has filmed himself taking a shower , to free himself of the thick layer of dung that covers his body.An earlier series of paintings is ' Saat Samunder Paar ' .
Baggages , migration and the " return home " have been enduring concerns of Subodh Gupta .
It is a theme that crystallised in works such as ' Across the Seven Seas ' ( 2006 ) where he uses baggage trolleys of modern airports to allude to the grim historical reality of migration from India , especially from his home state of Bihar.In works that Subodh Gupta presented at Hauser & Wirth in October 2009 , the artist moved away from composite sculptures toward objects that possess an auratic quality .
Ready-made commodities experience transformations in scale and material .
Relations to European art history were now to be found .
Among the new works is a three-dimensional reworking in bronze of Duchamp 's mustachioed Mona Lisa ' L.H.O.O.Q. ' ( 1919 ) .
His oil on canvas painting ' Saat Samundar Paar ' went under the hammer for Rs 34 million in the Saffronart autumn online auction .
In 2008 , he along with several other artists raised 39.3 million for Bihar flood victims.In 2010 , Gupta designed the stage set for the ballet CREATION 2010 by Angelin Preljocaj , the French choreographer .
The ballet was produced by the Bolshoi Theatre , Moscow , and the Ballet Preljocaj.Recent solo exhibitions include 2011 's ' Et Tu , Duchamp ' , at the KÖR am Kunsthalle in Vienna and ' A glass of water ' at Hauser & Wirth , New York.He has created a Banyan Tree from stainless steel which is kept in the National Gallery of Modern Art , New Delhi .

My Mother and Me was a cylindrical structure ten feet high made from cowpats with a layer of ash spread across the floor .
The seminal work was constructed during a workshop conducted by the Khoj Artists ' Association workshop at Modinagar near Delhi.Bihari , 1999Gupta addressed his identity and rural roots through a self-portrait enmeshed in cow dung and a single LED-inscribed Devanagiri word , “ Bihari , ” meaning someone from Bihar , a qualifier often used as a slur deriding his fellow people who seek economic refuge in other states .
In doing so he not only embraced his identity but a certain aesthetic that could otherwise be dismissed as kitschy.Very Hungry God , 2006In 2007 , this monumental skull composed of gleaming stainless steel vessels was displayed outside François Pinault 's Palazzo Grassi , at the 2007 Venice Biennale .
The French Billionaire had acquired the work that was displayed around the same time as Damien Hirst 's diamond-encrusted skull For the Love of God at White Cube . "
A giant skull made out of utensils , the sculpture related to the venerable Christian tradition of the memento mori , as well as modern special effects extravaganzas like The Mummy .
Subodh had managed to take a ubiquitous symbol and make it meaningful anew , an enormously difficult task that could only have been accomplished by a consummate artist , " wrote Indian art critic Girish Shahane in January 2007 .
What does the vessel contain , that the river does not , 2012Originally created for the first edition of the Kochi-Muziris Biennale , Gupta ’s poetically titled 21.35 m long , 3.15 m wide , 110 cm deep boat was stuffed with an assemblage of miscellaneous found objects ; abandoned chairs , beds , fishing nets , window frames et al. .
It was displayed at Hauser & Wirth ’s Savile Row space in London in 2013 .
Echoing sentiments of migration , displacement , belonging , movement , and stability , the work derives its title from a line in Rumi ’s “ The Sufi Path of Love ” : “ What does the vat contain that is not in the river ?
/ What does the room encompass that is not in the city ?
/ This world is the vat , and the heart the running stream , / this world the room , and the heart the city of wonders . ”

Multivariate cryptography is the generic term for asymmetric cryptographic primitives based on multivariate polynomials over a finite field F { \ displaystyle F } .
In certain cases those polynomials could be defined over both a ground and an extension field .
If the polynomials have the degree two , we talk about multivariate quadratics .
Solving systems of multivariate polynomial equations is proven to be NP-hard or NP-complete .
That 's why those schemes are often considered to be good candidates for post-quantum cryptography .
As of today , multivariate quadratics have been used to build signature schemes , but all attempts to build a secure encryption scheme have failed .
History In 1988 T. Matsumoto and H. Imai presented their scheme " Matsumoto-Imai-Scheme " on the Eurocrypt conference .
On later work the " Hidden Monomial Cryptosystems " was developed by ( French ) Jacques Patarin .
It is based on a ground and an extension field .
On this " Hidden Field Equations " was designed and presented in 1996 .
In the following years J. Patarin developed other schemes .
In 1997 he presented “ Balanced Oil & Vinegar ” and 1999 “ Unbalanced Oil and Vinegar ” in cooperation with Aviad Kipnis and Louis Goubin .
Construction Multivariate Quadratics involves a public and a private key .
The private key consists of two affine transformations , S and T , and an easy to invert quadratic map P ’ P ′ : F m → F n { \ displaystyle P ' : F ^ { m } \ rightarrow F ^ { n } } .
We denote the n { \ displaystyle n } by n { \ displaystyle n } matrix of the affine endomorphisms S : F n → F n { \ displaystyle S : F ^ { n } \ rightarrow F ^ { n } } by M S { \ displaystyle M _ { S } } and the shift vector by v S ∈ F n { \ displaystyle v _ { S } \ in F ^ { n } } and similarly for T : F m → F m { \ displaystyle T : F ^ { m } \ rightarrow F ^ { m } } .
In other words , S ( x ) = M S x + v S { \ displaystyle S ( x ) = M _ { S } x + v _ { S } } and T ( y ) = M T y ′ + v T { \ displaystyle T ( y ) = M _ { T } y ' + v _ { T } } .
The triple ( S − 1 , P ′ − 1 , T − 1 ) { \ displaystyle ( S ^ { -1 } , { P ' } ^ { -1 } , T ^ { -1 } ) } is the private key , also known as the trapdoor .
The public key is the composition P = S ∘ P ′ ∘ T { \ displaystyle P = S \ circ P ' \ circ T } which is by assumption hard to invert without the knowledge of the trapdoor .
Signature Signatures are generated using the private key and are verified using the public key as follows .
The message is hashed to a vector in y ∈ F n { \ displaystyle y \ in F ^ { n } } via a known hash function .
The signature is x = P − 1 ( y ) = T − 1 ( P ′ − 1 ( S − 1 ( y ) ) ) { \ displaystyle x =P ^ { -1 } ( y ) = T ^ { -1 } \ left ( { P ' } ^ { -1 } \ left ( S ^ { -1 } ( y ) \ right ) \ right ) } .
The receiver of the signed document must have the public key P in possession .
He computes the hash y and checks that the signature x fulfils P ( x ) = y { \ displaystyle P ( x ) = y } .

This article is about an establishment in Alabama .
For the location in Washington , D.C. , see Georgetown Visitation Monastery.The Convent and Academy of the Visitation , properly known today as the Visitation Monastery , is a historic complex of Roman Catholic religious buildings and a small cemetery in Mobile , Alabama , United States .
The buildings and grounds were documented by the Historic American Buildings Survey in 1937 .
They were added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 24 , 1992 as a part of Historic Roman Catholic Properties in Mobile Multiple Property Submission .
It , along with the Convent of Mercy , is one of two surviving historic convent complexes in Mobile .
History The Convent of the Visitation was founded by Bishop Michael Portier , the first bishop of Mobile .
Portier wished to found a convent for the Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary so that they could provide education to girls in his diocese , due to a lack of schools .
He obtained permission from Pope Gregory XVI for that purpose and in 1832 the first five sisters arrived from Georgetown.The academy taught 40 students the first year and enrollment continued to increase up until a fire in May 1854 destroyed the buildings .
Rebuilding of the convent commenced one month after the fire with a new quadrangle of buildings that form the core of the convent to the present day .
Architect James Henry Hutchisson designed these buildings in a French Renaissance style .
They were completed in 1855 .
The academy had grown to include a high school and grammar school by the early 1900s .
They were housed in a three-story school building on the west side of the quadrangle , built in 1900 .
Both had closed by 1952 and the former school building was demolished in 1953 .
The sisters then began a retreat house .
The retreat continues into the present , hosting retreat groups for men , women , and adolescents , as well as a variety of other events .
Numerous major restoration efforts were undertaken from 1985 to 1991 .
The interiors of Sacred Heart Chapel were completely restored beginning in 1998 with rededication late in 1999 .
Description The major buildings include the quadrangle of French Renaissance Revival style buildings completed in 1855 , in addition to several later structures .
The Romanesque Revival Sacred Heart Chapel was completed on the grounds in 1895 .
A priest 's house for visiting clerics was completed in 1899 , in a stylistic blending of the Romanesque Revival and Gothic Revival styles .
The grounds of the convent are enclosed with high brick walls , dating to the 1850s .
In addition to the outer wall , inner walls separate the public and private areas of the main complex and also enclose a private cemetery for the Order of the Visitation .
The graves are marked by simple white crosses .

Cyberethics is the philosophic study of ethics pertaining to computers , encompassing user behavior and what computers are programmed to do , and how this affects individuals and society .
For years , various governments have enacted regulations while organizations have defined policies about cyberethics .
Privacy history In the late 19th century , the invention of cameras spurred similar ethical debates as the internet does today .
During a seminar of Harvard Law Review in 1890 , Warren and Brandeis defined privacy from an ethical and moral point of view to be : " central to dignity and individuality and personhood .
Privacy is also indispensable to a sense of autonomy -- to ' a feeling that there is an area of an individual 's life that is totally under his or her control , an area that is free from outside intrusion . '
The deprivation of privacy can even endanger a person 's health . "
Over 100 years later , the internet and proliferation of private data through governments and ecommerce is an area which requires a new round of ethical debate involving a person 's privacy.Privacy can be decomposed to the limitation of others ' access to an individual with " three elements of secrecy , anonymity , and solitude . "
Anonymity refers to the individual 's right to protection from undesired attention .
Solitude refers to the lack of physical proximity of an individual to others .
Secrecy refers to the protection of personalized information from being freely distributed.Individuals surrender private information when conducting transactions and registering for services .
Ethical business practice protects the privacy of their customers by securing information which may contribute to the loss of secrecy , anonymity , and solitude .
Credit card information , social security numbers , phone numbers , mothers ' maiden names , addresses and phone numbers freely collected and shared over the internet may lead to a loss of Privacy.Fraud and impersonation are some of the malicious activities that occur due to the direct or indirect abuse of private information .
Identity theft is rising rapidly due to the availability of private information in the internet .
For instance , seven million Americans fell victim to identity theft in 2002 , and nearly 12 million Americans were victims of identity theft in 2011 making it the fastest growing crime in the United States .
Public records search engines and databases are the main culprits contributing to the rise of cybercrime .
Listed below are a few recommendations to restrict online databases from proliferating sensitive personnel information.Exclude sensitive unique identifiers from database records such as social security numbers , birth dates , hometown and mothers ' maiden names.Exclude phone numbers that are normally unlisted.Clear provision of a method which allows people to have their names removed from a database.Banning the reverse social security number lookup services .
Private data collection Data warehouses are used today to collect and store huge amounts of personal data and consumer transactions .
These facilities can preserve large volumes of consumer information for an indefinite amount of time .
Some of the key architectures contributing to the erosion of privacy include databases , cookies and spyware.Some may argue that data warehouses are supposed to stand alone and be protected .
However , the fact is enough personal information can be gathered from corporate websites and social networking sites to initiate a reverse lookup .
Therefore , is it not important to address some of the ethical issues regarding how protected data ends up in the public domain?As a result , identity theft protection businesses are on the rise .
Companies such as LifeLock and JPMorgan Chase have begun to capitalize on selling identity theft protection insurance .
Property Ethical debate has long included the concept of property .
This concept has created many clashes in the world of cyberethics .
One philosophy of the internet is centered around the freedom of information .
The controversy over ownership occurs when the property of information is infringed upon or uncertain .
Intellectual property rights The ever-increasing speed of the internet and the emergence of compression technology , such as mp3 opened the doors to Peer-to-peer file sharing , a technology that allowed users to anonymously transfer files to each other , previously seen on programs such as Napster or now seen through communications protocol such as BitTorrent .
Much of this , however , was copyrighted music and illegal to transfer to other users .
Whether it is ethical to transfer copyrighted media is another question.Proponents of unrestricted file sharing point out how file sharing has given people broader and faster access to media , has increased exposure to new artists , and has reduced the costs of transferring media ( including less environmental damage ) .
Supporters of restrictions on file sharing argue that we must protect the income of our artists and other people who work to create our media .
This argument is partially answered by pointing to the small proportion of money artists receive from the legitimate sale of media.We also see a similar debate over intellectual property rights in respect to software ownership .
The two opposing views are for closed source software distributed under restrictive licenses or for free and open source software .
The argument can be made that restrictions are required because companies would not invest weeks and months in development if there were no incentive for revenue generated from sales and licensing fees .
A counter argument to this is that standing on shoulders of giants is far cheaper when the giants do not hold IP rights .
Some proponents for open source believe that all programs should be available to anyone who wants to study them .
Digital rights management ( DRM ) With the introduction of digital rights management software , new issues are raised over whether the subverting of DRM is ethical .
Some champion the hackers of DRM as defenders of users ' rights , allowing the blind to make audio books of PDFs they receive , allowing people to burn music they have legitimately bought to CD or to transfer it to a new computer .
Others see this as nothing but simply a violation of the rights of the intellectual property holders , opening the door to uncompensated use of copyrighted media .
Accessibility , censorship and filtering Accessibility , censorship and filtering bring up many ethical issues that have several branches in cyberethics .
Many questions have arisen which continue to challenge our understanding of privacy , security and our participation in society .
Throughout the centuries mechanisms have been constructed in the name of protection and security .
Today the applications are in the form of software that filters domains and content so that they may not be easily accessed or obtained without elaborate circumvention or on a personal and business level through free or content-control software .
Internet censorship and filtering are used to control or suppress the publishing or accessing of information .
The legal issues are similar to offline censorship and filtering .
The same arguments that apply to offline censorship and filtering apply to online censorship and filtering ; whether people are better off with free access to information or should be protected from what is considered by a governing body as harmful , indecent or illicit .
The fear of access by minors drives much of the concern and many online advocate groups have sprung up to raise awareness and of controlling the accessibility of minors to the internet.Censorship and filtering occurs on small to large scales , whether it be a company restricting their employees ' access to cyberspace by blocking certain websites which are deemed as relevant only to personal usage and therefore damaging to productivity or on a larger scale where a government creates large firewalls which censor and filter access to certain information available online frequently from outside their country to their citizens and anyone within their borders .
One of the most famous examples of a country controlling access is the Golden Shield Project , also referred to as the Great Firewall of China , a censorship and surveillance project set up and operated by the People 's Republic of China .
Another instance is the 2000 case of the League Against Racism and Antisemitism ( LICRA ) , French Union of Jewish Students , vs. Yahoo! Inc ( USA ) and Yahoo! France , where the French Court declared that " access by French Internet users to the auction website containing Nazi objects constituted a contravention of French law and an offence to the ' collective memory ' of the country and that the simple act of displaying such objects ( e.g. exhibition of uniforms , insignia or emblems resembling those worn or displayed by the Nazis ) in France constitutes a violation of the Article R645-1 of the Penal Code and is therefore considered as a threat to internal public order . "
Since the French judicial ruling many websites must abide by the rules of the countries in which they are accessible .
Freedom of information Freedom of information , that is the freedom of speech as well as the freedom to seek , obtain and impart information brings up the question of who or what , has the jurisdiction in cyberspace .
The right of freedom of information is commonly subject to limitations dependent upon the country , society and culture concerned.Generally there are three standpoints on the issue as it relates to the internet .
First is the argument that the internet is a form of media , put out and accessed by citizens of governments and therefore should be regulated by each individual government within the borders of their respective jurisdictions .
Second , is that , " Governments of the Industrial World ... have no sovereignty [ over the Internet ] ... We have no elected government , nor are we likely to have one , ... You have no moral right to rule us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear . "
A third party believes that the internet supersedes all tangible borders such as the borders of countries , authority should be given to an international body since what is legal in one country may be against the law in another .
Digital divide An issue specific to the ethical issues of the freedom of information is what is known as the digital divide .
This refers to the unequal socio-economic divide between those who have had access to digital and information technology , such as cyberspace , and those who have had limited or no access at all .
This gap of access between countries or regions of the world is called the global digital divide .
Sexuality and pornography Sexuality in terms of sexual orientation , infidelity , sex with or between minors , public display and pornography have always stirred ethical controversy .
These issues are reflected online to varying degrees .
In terms of its resonance , the historical development of the online pornography industry and user-generated content have been the studied by media academics .
One of the largest cyberethical debates is over the regulation , distribution and accessibility of pornography online .
Hardcore pornographic material is generally controlled by governments with laws regarding how old one has to be to obtain it and what forms are acceptable or not .
The availability of pornography online calls into question jurisdiction as well as brings up the problem of regulation in particular over child pornography , which is illegal in most countries , as well as pornography involving violence or animals , which is restricted within most countries .
Gambling Gambling is often a topic in ethical debate as some view it as inherently wrong and support prohibition or controls while others advocate no legal . "
Between these extremes lies a multitude of opinions on what types of gambling the government should permit and where it should be allowed to take place .
Discussion of gambling forces public policy makers to deal with issues as diverse as addiction , tribal rights , taxation , senior living , professional and college sports , organized crime , neurobiology , suicide , divorce , and religion . "
Due to its controversy , gambling is either banned or heavily controlled on local or national levels .
The accessibility of the internet and its ability to cross geographic-borders have led to illegal online gambling , often offshore operations .
Over the years online gambling , both legal and illegal , has grown exponentially which has led to difficulties in regulation .
This enormous growth has even called into question by some the ethical place of gambling online .

Mike Morin ( born July 20 , 1971 ) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player .
Morin currently resides in Manchester , UK and is the Assistant Coach for the Manchester Storm .
Early career Born in Melville , Saskatchewan , Morin began his career at NCAA level , playing for Lake Superior State University .
Morin was a regular and reliable first team player , icing in 165 games in four seasons and scoring 129 points in the process.Morin then made the transition to professional standard ice hockey , signing for the ECHL team , the Richmond Renegades .
Again he would produce an excellent points output , with 38 points scored in just 47 appearances .
Unfortunately the Renegades failed to qualify for the post-season .
Morin would step up a level for the following season , 1995/96 , and would line up as a Providence Bruins player .
Although not a regular first teamer at the higher level , Morin would play 25 times during the regular season as well as making a handful of post-season appearances .
In 1996 , Morin would also briefly play roller hockey in the RHI for the San Jose Rhinos before returning to the more familiar ice surface for the following season .
Move to UK Ice Hockey Manchester Storm It would be the 1996/97 season when Morin would make the decision to move to Europe , signing for the Manchester Storm , once the best supported ice hockey team in Europe .
At the time the Storm were playing in the Ice Hockey Superleague , a newly established league which was proving popular with the fans .
It was then the highest standard of ice hockey in Europe .
Morin proved himself to be somewhat of an ' unsung hero ' for the Storm , and through his hard work and dedication became one of the most important players on the team.Morin showed loyalty to the Storm , playing for them for six seasons in total , up until the end of the 2001/02 season when his contract was not renewed by then head coach Daryl Lipsey .
Morin 's work rate , effort and physical style combined with his loyalty to the organisation meant that he was firmly established as a ' fan favourite ' in Manchester by the time of his departure , with many fans calling for a testimonial game .
BNL and Sheffield Steelers After his contract was not renewed , Morin took the opportunity to sign for the Hull Thunder , a team icing in the British National League , generally regarded as the league below the ISL .
Morin 's experience at the higher level served him well as he scored 17 points in 22 games .
It would be a brief spell in the BNL for Morin as he would be signed , part way through the season by the ISL Sheffield Steelers .
It was a move that many saw as controversial due to the intense rivalry between the Storm and the Steelers , often referred to as the ' War of the Roses ' .
Manchester Phoenix Morin was released by the Steelers in 2003 , and was promptly re-signed with the newly established Manchester Phoenix organisation - he was in fact head coach Rick Brebant 's first signing .
The Phoenix had been established following the collapse of the Manchester Storm in 2003 due to off-ice financial problems .
The 2003/04 season would be the Phoenix 's first competitive season and it would be in the Elite Ice Hockey League , which was formed after the gradual meltdown of the ISL .
Morin re-claimed his place as fan favourite in Manchester and was installed as alternate captain as a recognition for his years of service to ice hockey in Manchester .
Morin is one of a handful of players to have played for both Manchester Storm and Manchester Phoenix.At the end of the 2003/04 season , the Phoenix franchise would be temporarily suspended , again due to financial costs .
This prompted Morin to declare his retirement from the game .
Morin is still a widely popular figure in U.K. ice hockey , especially in Manchester , where he is regarded as one of the most respected players to play professional standard ice hockey in the city .
Move into Coaching On the 24h November 2015 , it was announced that Morin would be returning to the Manchester Storm as Assistant Coach .
Morin remains in this position as of the 2017/18 season .
Shirt Retirement At the end of the 2016/17 season , it was announced by the Manchester Storm organisation that Morin 's number 15 shirt would be shirt retirement for services to Manchester Storm both as a player and assistant coach .
The shirt retirement took place on 12 November 2017 prior to a match against Milton Keynes Lightning .

The Kokusai Ki-59 ( 一式輸送機 , Isshiki-yusōki ) was an early 1940s light transport monoplane built by Nippon Kokusai Koku Kogyo K.K for the Imperial Japanese Army as a development of the Teradako-ken TK-3 which had first flown in 1938 .
Development The Teradako-ken TK-3 was a prototype eight-to-ten passenger light transport monoplane built by Nippon Koku Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha as a short-range transport for civil use at the request of Imperial Japanese Airways to replace its aging fleet of Airspeed Envoys and Fokker Super Universals .
The first of two prototypes flew in June 1938 , but was unable to meet the required performance requirements and the project was cancelled .
In 1939 , the Imperial Japanese Army revived the project to meet its urgent requirement for a light transport and liaison aircraft and instructed Nippon to develop the design as the Ki-59 .
The Ki-59 was a high-wing cantilever monoplane with a fixed tailwheel landing gear and conventional single vertical tail surfaces .
It was powered by two 450 hp ( 336 kW ) Hitachi Ha-13a radial engines and other modifications to the design were made to meet Army requirements .
The Ki-59 was ordered into production in 1941 with the designation Army Type 1 Transport , and an additional 59 units were produced .
After the start of World War II , the aircraft was given the Allied reporting name Theresa .
Despite the more powerful engines and modifications sponsored by the Japanese Army , the Ki-59 remained a poor performer and saw little service before being replaced by the more capable Tachikawa Ki-54 .
A small number were transferred to Manchukuo National Airways.Near the end of 1941 one Ki-59 was modified into a glider with the removal of the engines and the landing gear replaced by underfuselage skids .
It was designated the Ku-8-I or Army Experimental Glider .
This was further developed as the Ku-8-II or Army Type 4 Large Transport Glider which became the only operationally-used Japanese assault glider .
It was named ' Gander ' by the Allies .

Mohegan-Pequot ( also known as Mohegan-Pequot-Montauk , Secatogue , and Shinnecock-Poosepatuck ; dialects in New England included Mohegan , Pequot , and Niantic ; and on Long Island , Montauk and Shinnecock ) is an extinct Algonquian language formerly spoken by indigenous peoples in southern present-day New England and eastern Long Island .
History The Mohegan Indian Tribe was historically based in central southern Connecticut .
While originally part of the Pequot people , it gradually became independent and allied with English colonists in the Pequot War of 1637 .
This broke the power in the region of the Pequot who were formerly the dominant tribe .
In reward , the English gave Western Pequot taken as captives to the Mohegan .
20th century to present In 1933 John E. Hamilton , also known as Chief Rolling Cloud , was appointed Grand Sachem for Life of the Mohegan by his mother , Alice Storey .
The Mohegan had a matrilineal kinship system , and male leaders were chosen by women elders from families with hereditary claims to the position .
Storey was a direct descendant of Uncas , the great 17th-century leader of the Mohegan Nation , and of Tamaquashad , Grand Sachem of the Pequot Nation .
In Mohegan tradition , the position of tribal leadership called Grand Sachem had always been hereditary through the maternal line.Gladys Tantaquidgeon , who died at the age of 106 in 2005 , served for years as the Tribe 's medicine woman and unofficial historian .
She became an anthropologist and worked for a decade with the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs .
Returning to Connecticut , she operated her family 's tribal Tantaquidgeon Museum for more than 50 years , beginning in 1947 .
It was one of the first museums to be owned and operated by Native Americans.John Hamilton was a key figure among Native American leaders initiating late twentieth century land claims suits .
Tribes in the Northeast had long interaction with European Americans .
There was continued encroachment of their lands , even when colonial-era reservations were established .
By the early 20th century , many of the tribes in the Northeast were essentially landless.In the period of mid - and late-20th century increased Native American activism , the Mohegan and other Northeast tribes filed federal land claims suits seeking to recover land or compensation for what they had lost .
The courts ruled in their favor , in cases in which states had conducted illegal arrangements with tribal leaders , without gaining US Senate approval .
Congress passed bills to ratify these settlements , which often involved compensation for lands lost , or land set aside for the tribes , and sometimes compensation , in addition to official federal recognition of the groups as tribes .
The so-called " state tribes " were those along the East Coast who had been recognized by the English Crown through treaties and other documentation long before individual colonial or state governments had been established .
But , as the Native people lost their traditional lands and were not assigned reservations , they did not maintain their sovereign legal status associated with federal recognition.In the 1960s , during a period of rising activism among Native Americans , Hamilton filed a number of land claims authorized by the " Council of Descendants of Mohegan Indians . "
The group had some 300 members at the time.In 1970 the Montville , Connecticut faction of the Mohegan expressed its dissatisfaction with Hamilton 's land-claims litigation .
They wanted a change in direction .
When the Hamilton supporters left a council meeting , the remainder elected Courtland Fowler as their new leader .
Notes of that Council meeting referred to Hamilton as Sachem.The group led by John Hamilton worked with the attorney Jerome Griner in federal land claims through the 1970s .
The Fowler faction opposed this .
In addition , a Kent , Connecticut property owners ' organization , with native and non-native members , opposed the Hamilton land claims and the petition for federal recognition .
These people were worried that their property values might be affected .
Federal process for recognition In response to the petitions by additional tribes seeking federal recognition , in 1978 the Bureau of Indian Affairs ( BIA ) established a formal administrative process and criteria to be satisfied to prove cultural continuity ; they established these in consultation with federally recognized tribes .
That year , as authorized by the Council of Descendants , Hamilton submitted the Mohegan Tribe 's first petition for federal recognition.John Hamilton died in 1988 .
In his will , he named Eleanor Fortin as the Grand Sachem of the Mohegan people .
She became the leader of the " Hamilton group , " which continued to contend with the " Fowler faction " over tribal policy .
Despite their disagreements , both groups continued to participate in tribal activities and to identify as Mohegan people.By 1989 , the Fowler faction had revived Hamilton 's 1978 petition for federal recognition , which had been dormant for some years .
The BIA 's preliminary finding was that the Mohegan had not satisfied the criteria of documenting continuity in social community , and demonstrating political authority and influence as a tribe , through the twentieth century.In 1990 , the Mohegan under Fowler submitted a detailed response to address the BIA 's concerns .
They included compiled genealogies and other records , some of which had been collected and preserved by Hamilton and his followers .
For instance , Eleanor Fortin had allowed the MTIC ( Mohegan Tribe of Indians of Connecticut ) researchers access to records pertaining to the Mohegan Congregational Church in Montville .
The researchers had assured Fortin that if federal recognition were achieved , it would cover the entire surviving Mohegan population .
They also used records maintained by Gladys Tantaquidgeon , who had kept genealogy and vital statistics of tribal members for her anthropological research.In 1990 , the MTIC ruled the tribe 's membership be restricted to documented descendants from a single family , ca. 1860 .
This criteria excludes some of the Hamilton followers .
By law , a federally recognized tribe has the authority to determine its own rules for membership .
The MTIC tried to sue other Mohegan over their use of the tribal identity as well as their crafting , but they were unsuccessful .
Final determination , 1994 In its 1994 " Final Determination , " the BIA cited the vital statistics and genealogies as documents that were decisive in demonstrating " that the tribe did indeed have social and political continuity during the middle of the 20th century . "
The former Fowler group gained federal recognition as the Mohegan Tribe of Indians of Connecticut ( MTIC ) .
They do not acknowledge John Hamilton as Grand Sachem in their history , but say that Harold Tantaquidgeon was their chief prior to the era of federal recognition.That same year , Congress passed the Mohegan Nation ( Connecticut ) Land Claim Settlement Act , which authorized the United States to take land into trust to establish a reservation for the Mohegan and settle their land claim .
The final 1994 agreement between MTIC and the State in the settlement of land claims extinguished all pending land claims.The Mohegan Tribe of Indians of Connecticut is the only federally recognized tribe of the Mohegan people.Descendants of the followers of John Hamilton continue to function as a Mohegan band independently of the MTIC .
They hold periodic gatherings and activities .
Language endangerment and revitalization efforts As of 2014 , there are between 1,400 and 1,700 recorded tribal members ( these figures vary by source ) .
The Mohegan language has been dormant for approximately 100 years ; the last native speaker , Fidelia A.H. Fielding , died in 1908 .
Fielding , a descendant of Chief Uncas , is deemed the preserver of the language .
She left four diaries that are being used in the 21st-century process of restoring the language .
She also took part in preserving the traditional culture .
She practiced a traditional Mohegan way of life and was the last person to live in the traditional log dwelling.Another important tribal member was Gladys Tantaquidgeon , who was the tribe 's medicine woman from 1916 until her death in 2005 .
She too assisted greatly in maintaining the Mohegan culture , as she collected thousands of tribal documents and artifacts .
These documents were of critical importance to supporting the tribe 's documentation for its case for federal recognition , which was approved in 1994 .
As of 2010 , the Shinnecock and Unkechaug nations of Long Island , New York , had begun work with the State University of New York at Stony Brook , Southampton Campus , to revive their languages , or dialects of the above.As of 2012 , the Mohegan Language Project had created lessons , a dictionary , and other online learning materials to revive their language .
The project also has a complete grammar in the works , which has been put together by Stephanie Fielding .
The primary goal of the project is for the next generation of Mohegan people to be fluent.Many of the dictionaries circulating are based on Prince and Speck 's interpretation of testimony by the Mohegan woman , Dji 's Butnaca ( Flying Bird ) , also known as Fidelia A.H. Fielding.The Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center collection includes a 1992 menu " which attempts to translate such words as hamburger and hot dog into Mohegan-Pequot . "
The language was documented as early as the 17th century . "
In 1690 , a Pequot vocabulary list was compiled by Rev. James Noyes in Groton .
In 1717 , Experience Mayhew , a Congregational Minister translated the Lord 's Prayer into Mohegan-Pequot .
Ezra Stiles , president of Yale University collected Pequot linguistic data in Groton in 1762 . "
Bahá ' í prayers have been translated into the Mohegan-Pequot language . "
It is a sacred obligation , " says the Golden Hill Paugussett Chief , Big Eagle . "
Indian people must keep their languages alive .
If the language is not spoken , it must be made to live again . "
Phonology Vowel Sounds Simple vowels Diphthongs Morphology NounsNouns in Mohegan have two forms : animate and inanimate .
They are further distinguished by number .
Animate nouns include people , animals , heavenly bodies ( sun , moon , stars , but not clouds ) , and spirits .
There are other items that call fall into the category of animate such as certain cultural items and plants , but it is not known why these items are considered animate .
It is something that is simply learned and memorized .
One way to help identify if a noun is animate or inanimate is to look at its plural form .
Plural animate nouns typically end in - k while plural inanimate nouns ends in - sh.Animate nouns have four forms : singular , plural , obviative and locative .
The obviative form is used when there are two or more animate third persons in a sentence .
The obviative is used when a noun or pronoun is the object of the verb ( the object is the obviate ) , or if the third person is possessed by another person .
The locative is used to show where something is spatially .
Note that there is no obviative form for inanimate nouns , and neither the obviative nor the locative have plural forms ( plurality is known through context ) .
VerbsVerbs in Mohegan come in several forms .
Independent verbs exist in four forms : inanimate intransitive , animate intransitive , transitive inanimate and transitive animate .
There is also the conjunct form which does not carry the affixes ( used to clarify person ) that the aforementioned hold .
Person , number and gender PersonMohegan animate intransitive verbs show who the subject is by utilizing affixes .
Singular forms have prefixes , but third person ( singular and plural ) only have suffixes .
In the plural forms there are inclusive and exclusive suffixes ; the inclusive we includes the person who is speaking as well as the person he/she is talking to whereas the exclusive we does not include the person the speaker is talking to .
When an animate intransitive verb stem ends in a long vowel ( á , i , o or ô ) the 3rd person singular does not take a final - w , and in the 3rd person plural these same verbs take - k as an ending in lieu of - wak .
* affixes indicated in bold type * affixes indicated in bold typeNumbers Space Locative caseThe locative case is used to show where something is .
Mohegan utilizes the suffix - uk to indicate spatial relationships , which can be compared to the English prepositions " on , " " at , " and " in . "
In Mohegan there is no plural form to go with the obviative and the locative : the same form is used for singular and plural with the difference being distinguished by context.Example of the Locative CaseAbsentative caseThe absentative case is used to when referencing a person who has died ( this includes any property that they left behind ) .
This is accomplished by adding a suffix to either his/her name , title or the property .
* suffix indicated by bold typeThe following example shows the absentative case in use : Niswi nusihsuk wikôtamak áposuhutut.Both of my late uncles enjoyed cooking .
Syntax PossessionIn Mohegan any noun can be possessed , however , there is a distinction in possessive relationships and that is the alienability distinction .
Some nouns are able to stand alone without showing possession ( alienable ) , while others must show a possessor ( inalienable ) .
Nouns pertaining to kinship and body parts are always classified as inalienable , but there are some terms that do n't fall under either of these umbrellas that must be classified as inalienable such as the noun " home . "
Various affixes are used to denote inalienability and different affixes are used to differentiate animate/inanimate and singular/plural .
Additionally , when a term requires possession but the possessor is unclear or unknown it is marked with prefix that indicates an indefinite possessor.The locative ( - uk ) and obviate ( - ah ) suffixes are added to the 1st , 2nd , and 3rd person singular forms .
Whether the word is singular or plural should be suggested in the content of the sentence .
The obviate affixes only go on animate nouns.When a possessed noun is plural it must be shown .
With an animate noun then suffix - ak is combined with the possessive ending ( with the exception of third person singular and third person plural , where the plural is the same as the singular ) .
* affixes on all charts are marked by bold typeClause CombiningIn Mohegan grammar verbs that are in a dependent clause are said to be in the conjunct order .
Conjunct verbs have the same numbers of persons for each verb , but they do not have prefixes , only suffixes .
In turn , all of the person information is at the end of the word .
* suffixes on chart marked by bold typeExample : Mô yáyuw maci ákacuyǒn.Translation : It was so bad that I am ashamed.When in the conjunct form if the first vowel of the word is a short vowel , that is / a / or / u / , it changes to a long / á / .
Transitive verbs with inanimate objects take only a suffix as well .
The suffix vary based on the ending of the stem.For stems that end in - m - or - n - the suffixes are as follows :1 st person singular : - ôn2nd person singular : - an3rd person singular : - k1st person plural : - ak2nd person plural : - áq3rd person plural : - hutut3rd person plural participle : - kikIndefinite subject ( passive ) : - ukFor stems that end in - o - the suffixes are as follows :1 st person singular : - yôn2nd person singular : - yan3rd person singular : - ôk1st person plural : - yak2nd person plural : - yáq3rd person plural : - w ' hutut3rd person plural participle : - ôkikIndefinite subject ( passive ) : - mukFor stems that end in - u - the suffixes are as follows :1 st person singular : - wôn2nd person singular : - wan3rd person singular : - k1st person plural : - wak2nd person plural : - wáq3rd person plural : - ' hutut3rd person plural participle : - kikIndefinite subject ( passive ) : - muk See also Mohegan peoplePequotMontaukettNiantic peopleShinnecock Indian Nation Notes References Mashantucket Pequot Research Library , Pequot and Related Languages , A Bibliography Articles Cowan , William .

Mariamne is a 1725 French tragedy by Augustin Nadal based around the Herodian dynasty.Nadal was encouraged to produce the play after his rival Voltaire 's play on the same story had failed after only one performance the previous year ( 1724 ) .
However , at the play 's February 1725 premiere at the Comédie-Française , the audience booed its opening scenes and demanded that Voltaire 's play be put on instead.Nadal was convinced his own Mariamne had failed because of Voltaire 's " brigue horrible et scandaleuse " that set Paris against it , and said so in the preface to the printed play , accusing him of bringing a cabal into the audience at the premiere to disrupt it .
This gave Voltaire the opportunity to reply under a pseudonym with withering compliments ( " Lettre de M. Thieriot à M. l'Abbé Nadal " , 1725 ) , commiserating with Nadal , that it was solely the machinations of Voltaire 's intrigues " that one hears it said so scandalously that you are the worst versifier of the century and the most tiresome writer . "
Voltaire 's fine-honed savagery inspired Nadal to excise the uncomplimentary remarks about Voltaire in his prefaces when he came to collect and publish the plays in 1736 with others of his poems , in three small volumes .
But it is in Voltaire 's response that the abbé Nadal is remembered .

Gay affirmative psychotherapy is a form of psychotherapy for non-heterosexuals , specifically gay and lesbian clients , which focuses on client comfort in working towards authenticity and self-acceptance regarding sexual orientation , and does not attempt to " change " them to heterosexual , or to " eliminate or diminish " same-sex " desires and behaviors " .
The American Psychological Association ( APA ) offers guidelines and materials for gay affirmative psychotherapy .
Affirmative psychotherapy states that homosexuality or bisexuality is not a mental illness , in accordance with global scientific consensus .
In fact , embracing and affirming gay identity can be a key component to recovery from other mental illnesses or substance abuse .
Clients whose religious beliefs are interpreted as teaching against homosexual behavior may require some other method of integration of their possibly conflicting religious and sexual selves .
Guidelines Countering psychiatry over the past hundred years that saw homosexuality to be a mental illness , current guidelines instead encourage psychotherapists to assist patients in overcoming the stigma of homosexuality rather than the sexual orientation .
Because some mental health professionals are unfamiliar with the social difficulties of the coming out process , particular to other factors such as age , race , ethnicity , or religious affiliation , they are encouraged by the APA to learn more about how gay , lesbian , and bisexual clients face discrimination in its various forms .
Many gays and lesbians are rejected from their own families and form their own familial relationships and support systems that may also be unfamiliar to mental health professionals , who are encouraged to take into account the diversity of extended relationships in lieu of family .
For some clients , acting on same-sex attraction may not be a fulfilling solution as it may conflict with their religious beliefs ; licensed mental health providers may approach such a situation by neither rejecting nor promoting celibacy .
Research One of the emerging areas of research regarding gay affirmative psychotherapy is related to the process of assisting LGBTQ individuals from religious backgrounds feel comfortable with their sexual and gender orientation .
Narrative analyses of clinicians ' reports regarding gay affirmative psychotherapy suggest that the majority of conflicts discussed within the therapeutic context by gay men and their relatives from religious backgrounds are related to the interaction between family , self , and religion .
Clinicians report that gay men and their families struggle more frequently with the institution , community , and practices of religion rather than directly with God .
Chana Etengoff and Colette Daiute report in the Journal of Homosexuality that clinicians most frequently address these tensions by emphasizing the mediational strategies of increasing self-awareness , seeking secular support ( e.g. , PFLAG ) , and increasing positive communication between family members .
German government action In March 2008 , the German federal government ( CDU/SPD ) summarized the professional consensus as indicating that homosexuality is not an illness , and that conversion therapy is dangerous and does n't help homosexual people .
Voluntary changes to sexual orientation are not an option , according to the administration 's answer to parliamentary questioning , as these attempts may cause personal harm .
The German government also made the point that Gay Affirmative Psychotherapy can help clients .

" The Inverted Forest " is a novella by J. D. Salinger , first published in Cosmopolitan magazine in December 1947 , and republished in Cosmopolitan 's " Diamond Jubilee " issue in March 1961 .
The story marked the start of Salinger 's focus on the poet as a distinguished creative genius , and on the impossibilities he finds when trying to adapt to society .
Plot summary The story opens with a diary entry from an eleven-year-old Corinne von Nordhoffen , heiress to a large orthopedic supply company .
The young girl laments at the fact that while others have offered her gifts for her birthday the real present she wants is Raymond Ford .
On the night of her birthday , she waits in vain for him to show .
Her driver is directed to head to Ford 's house , across town .
When they arrive at the address all they see is a closed restaurant but realize that in fact Ford lives upstairs , with his mother .
Corinne talks with Ford briefly as he suddenly exits the apartment with his mother who chides him for being slow .
He is carrying a large suitcase and when asked where he is going he says " I do n't know ... goodbye . "
At seventeen Corinne was a beautiful but naive student attending Wellesley College .
After graduating she goes to Europe and meets many men .
One boyfriend dies in a car accident and Corinne moves to New York City to a " darling , overpriced apartment in the East Sixties . "
She gets a job after contacting an old friend from college , Robert Waner ( who we learn is narrating the story ) .
Waner sets her up as an editor at a magazine .
He proposes to her and she rejects him .
After some months of working for him Waner introduces her to the work of a poet ( specifically a book of poems called The Cowardly Morning ) whose works are " Coleridge and Blake and Rilke all in one , and more . "
The first poem is the title poem , Corinne reads it and " felt sorry for the poet for having her as a reader . "
She reads through it again and begins to appreciate the symbolism : Not a wasteland , but a great inverted forest/with all the foliage underground.Corinne is floored by the poem , calls Waner and tries to get more information on the poet .
His name is Ray Ford , twice winner of a prestigious fellowship and an instructor at Columbia University ( the same college Salinger 's Seymour Glass teaches at ) .
Corinne arranges a meeting with Ford , where he tells her what happened to him .
As a young man he worked at a smoky race track , running bets for people .
He is befriended by a woman who begins to write poems he must read on scraps of paper .
Following her advice , he reads them ( using her library ) , then memorizes them , until he has a volume of poetry in his mind .
His vision impaired , Ford writes his own poems at this point , with large block lettering .
Ford explains that the poetry emerged from him slowly , and with the pain of his life at that time.Corinne is mesmerized by Raymond Ford and initiates a romantic relationship .
The two of them meet regularly at a Chinese food restaurant and talk .
She invites him to a party .
Reluctantly , he accepts .
While there he is quiet until he starts on a poet he admires and impresses the academics at the party without showing off his genius.Soon after she and Ford are married , Corinne receives a letter in the mail .
It is from a Mary Croft , who had noticed the wedding announcement in the New York Times and who wants Ford to read some of her poetry .
Corinne invites Croft to their house .
When she arrives Ford dismisses her work and asserts " a poet does n't invent his poetry -- he finds it . "
Ford and Corinne 's relationship begins to crack under the stress of the poet 's dedication to his work and introspection .
Ford leaves Corinne ; later , following a lead from a man who turns out to be Croft 's estranged husband , Corinne finds Ford living with Croft .
Among other things , Croft 's husband reveals that his wife is older than she appears ( a woman of 31 , not a college girl of 20 , as she 'd claimed to be ) , and the negligent mother of a ten-year-old son.Ford lives with Croft in a large Pennsylvania city , in a dilapidated apartment bereft of literature .
He is drinking a highball when Corinne shows up to see him .
His senses dulled , and his creative output stymied , Ford is a prisoner of " the Brain . "
This , he explains to Corinne , is his mother : The insensitive and cruel person who had first introduced him to the world of the ignorant and dull .
Corinne pleads with him to come back but he does n't .
Instead , Ford , the genius who sees what others ca n't , closes his eyes to the world of beauty by drowning his perceptions in ether and making himself dependent upon a woman who reincarnates his dead mother .

In mid-September 2011 , the Acid3 test was revised to remove a few " antiquated and unusual " tests and as a result IE9 now passes the test with a score of 100/100At MIX 10 , the first Internet Explorer 9 Platform Preview was released , which featured support for CSS3 and SVG , a new JavaScript engine called Chakra , and a score of 55/100 on the Acid3 test , up from 20/100 for Internet Explorer 8 .
On May 5 , 2010 , the second Internet Explorer 9 Platform Preview was released , which featured a score of 68/100 on the Acid3 test and faster performance on the WebKit SunSpider JavaScript benchmark than the first Internet Explorer 9 Platform Preview .
On June 23 , 2010 , the third Internet Explorer 9 Platform Preview was released , which featured a score of 83/100 on the Acid3 test and a faster JavaScript engine than the second Internet Explorer 9 Platform Preview .
The third Internet Explorer 9 Platform Preview also includes support for HTML5 audio , video , and canvas tags , and WOFF .
On August 4 , 2010 , the fourth Internet Explorer 9 Platform Preview was released , which features a score of 95/100 on the Acid3 test and a faster JavaScript engine than the third Internet Explorer 9 Platform Preview .
On September 15 , 2010 , the Internet Explorer 9 Public Beta was released alongside Platform Preview 5 , featuring a new user interface .
In contrast to the previews , the Beta replaces any previously installed version of Internet Explorer .
The sixth Internet Explorer 9 Platform Preview was released on October 28 , 2010 , and includes support for CSS3 2D transforms and HTML5 semantic elements .
The seventh Internet Explorer 9 Platform Preview was released on November 17 , 2010 , and features better JavaScript performance.These previews were not full builds of Internet Explorer 9 , as they were for testing the latest version of the Trident layout engine .
They were for web developers to send feedback on the improvements made , functioned in parallel with any other installed browsers , and were previews of the renderer technology only , containing minimalistic user interfaces and lacking traditional interface elements such as an address bar and navigation buttons .
Microsoft updated these previews approximately every eight weeks.On November 23 , 2010 , two updates for the Internet Explorer 9 Public Beta were released .
KB2448827 brings improvements to reliability and fixes stability issues from the previous beta release .
There are not much details of resolved issues disclosed by Microsoft .
Moreover , KB2452648 resolves the in-built feedback issue with Internet Explorer 9 and the latest version of Windows Live Sign-in Assistant .
These updates can be fetched from Windows Update or the Microsoft Download Center website .
On the same day , Internet Explorer build 9.0.8027.6000 based on Internet Explorer 9 Platform Preview 7 was leaked .
On February 10 , 2011 , the Internet Explorer 9 Release Candidate and Platform Preview 8 were released .
The Release Candidate version featured improved performance , a Tracking Protection feature , a refined UI , support for more web standards , and other improvements.The final version of Internet Explorer 9 was publicly released during the South by Southwest ( SXSW ) Interactive conference in Austin , Texas , on March 14 , 2011 .
Changes from previous versions User Interface Internet Explorer 9 includes significant alterations to its user interface when compared with previous versions .
These include : Pinned Sites : Integrates with the Windows 7 taskbar to make web site experience more like an application where users may " pin " a site and then return to it later like a shortcut .
In the release candidate , users can pin a site and add more homepages to that site ( e.g. pin Facebook and add Twitter as another homepage to that pinned site , so it would become a social program ) Security-enabled Download Manager : Manages file transfers and can pause and resume downloads and informs if a file may be maliciousEnhanced Tabs and Tab Page : the new tab page can show most visited sites , and tabs are shown next to the address bar ( there is an option to have a separate row , like in Internet Explorer 8 ) with the feature of closing an inactive tab .
Tabs can be " torn off " which means they can be dragged up and down to be moved from one IE window to another .
This also ties in with the Aero Snap feature.Add-on Performance Advisor : Shows which third-party add-ons may be slowing down browser performance and then allows the option to disable or remove themCompact user interface , which includes the removal of the separate search box found in Internet Explorer 7 and 8 .
Also removed is the tab menu list found in Internet Explorer 8 .
Scripting JavaScript engine Internet Explorer 9 ( 32-bit ) features a faster JavaScript engine than Internet Explorer 8 's , internally known as Chakra .
Chakra has a separate background thread for compiling JavaScript .
Windows runs that thread in parallel on a separate core when one is available .
Compiling in the background enables users to keep interacting with webpages while Internet Explorer 9 generates even faster code .
By running separately in the background , this process can take advantage of modern multi-core machines.In Microsoft 's preliminary SunSpider benchmarks for the third 32-bit Internet Explorer 9 Platform Preview , it outperformed the Internet Explorer 8 engine by a factor of 10 and also outperformed the newest Firefox 4.0 pre-release .
Microsoft provided information that its new javascript engine uses dead code elimination optimization for faster performance , which included a small section of code in the SunSpider test as dead code .
Robert Sayre , a Mozilla developer investigated this further , showing that Internet Explorer 9 's preview 3 dead code elimination had bugs , providing test cases exposing these bugs resulting in wrong compilation.After its final release , 32-bit Internet Explorer 9 has been tested to be the leading mainstream browser in the Sunspider performance test.The engine significantly improves support for ECMA-262 : ECMAScript Language Specification standard , including features new to the recently finalized Fifth Edition of ECMA-262 ( often abbreviated ES5 ) .
The Internet Explorer 9 browser release scored only 3 faults from 10440 tests in the Test262 Ecmascript conformance test ( Ver .
0.6.2 5-Apr-2011 ) created by Ecma International.The 64-bit version of Internet Explorer 9 , which is not the default browser even on 64-bit systems , does not have the JIT compiler and performs up to 4 times slower .
DOM DOM improvements include : DOM Traversal and RangeFull DOM L2 and L3 eventsgetComputedStyle from DOM StyleDOMContentLoaded CSS Internet Explorer 9 has improved Cascading Style Sheets ( CSS ) support .
The Internet Explorer 9 implementation report , which was created using Internet Explorer 9 Beta , shows Internet Explorer 9 passing 97.7 % of all tests on the W3C CSS 2.1 test suite .
This is the highest pass rate amongst CSS 2.1 implementation reports submitted to W3C.CSS3 improvements include support for the following modules : CSS3 2D Transforms CSS3 Backgrounds and Borders CSS3 Color CSS3 Fonts CSS3 Media Queries CSS3 Namespaces CSS3 Values and Units CSS3 Selectors HTML5 HTML5 Media Internet Explorer 9 includes support for the HTML5 video and audio tags.The audio tag will include native support for the MP3 and AAC codecs , while the video tag will natively support H. 264/MPEG -4 AVC .
Support for other video formats , such as WebM , will require third-party plugins .
HTML5 Canvas Internet Explorer 9 includes support for the HTML5 canvas element .
HTML5 Inline SVG support The first Internet Explorer 9 Platform Preview has support for : Methods of embedding : inline HTML , inline XHTML , <object> , full .
svg documentsStructure : <svg> , <defs> , <use> , <g> , <image> Shapes : <circle> , <ellipse> , <rect> , <line> , <polyline> , <polygon> , <path> TextFilling , Stroking , ( CSS3 ) ColorDOML2 Core and SVGDOMEventsPresentation Attributes and CSS StylingTransform definitions : translate , skewX , skewY , scale , rotateSVG elements that are supported in the Platform Preview are fully implemented .
Elements that exist in the Platform Preview have corresponding SVGDOM support and can be styled with CSS/presentation attributes.The final build of Internet Explorer 9 also supports : Methods of embedding : <embed> , <iframe> , <img> , css image , .
svgzGradients and PatternsClipping , Masking , and CompositingCursor , MarkerRemainder of Text , Transforms , Events Web typography Internet Explorer was the first browser to support web fonts through the @font - face rule , but only supported the Embedded OpenType ( EOT ) format , and lacked support for parts of the CSS3 fonts module .
Internet Explorer 9 completed support for the CSS3 fonts module and added WOFF support .
It is the first version of Internet Explorer to support TTF fonts , but will only use them if none of their embedding permission bits are set .
Navigation Timings Internet Explorer 9 implements the new W3C Navigation Timings format .
Microsoft has been a part of creating this format during the development of Internet Explorer 9 .
Tracking Protection Internet Explorer 9 includes a Tracking Protection feature which improves upon Internet Explorer 8 's InPrivate Filtering .
Internet Explorer 8 's InPrivate Filtering blocked third-party content using an XML list which had to be imported or automatically built a list by observing third-party servers that users kept interacting with as they browsed the web , and once a server showed up more than a set number of times , InPrivate Filtering would block future connections to itInternet Explorer 9 supports two methods of tracking protection .
The primary method is through the use of Tracking Protection Lists ( TPL ) which are now supplied by internet privacy-related organizations or companies .
Tracking Protection by default remains on once enabled , unlike InPrivate Filtering which had to be enabled each time Internet Explorer 8 started .
When a TPL is selected , Internet Explorer 9 blocks or allows third-party URI downloads based on rules in the TPL .
Users can create their personal TPL 's or select a TPL supplied by a third party.The other method is the use of a Do Not Track header and DOM property .
Browser requests from Internet Explorer 9 include this header whenever a TPL is selected .
Websites that follow this header should not deliver tracking mechanisms in their websites .
At the moment following this header is a voluntary code of conduct but this method could in future be enforced by government legislation.These tracking protection methods were submitted to W3C for standardization .
Malware protection Internet Explorer 9 uses layered protection against malware .
It uses technical measures to protect its memory like the DEP/NSX protection , Safe Exception handlers ( SafeSEH ) and ASLR protection used in Internet Explorer 8 .
In addition to those existing forms of memory protection , Internet Explorer 9 now opts-in to SEHOP ( Structured Exception Handler Overwrite Protection ) which works by validating the integrity of the exception handling chain before dispatching exceptions .
This helps ensure that structured exception handling can not be used as an exploit vector , even when running outdated browser add-ons that have not been recompiled to take advantage of SafeSEH.In addition , Internet Explorer 9 is compiled with the new C++ compiler provided with Visual Studio 2010 .
This compiler includes a feature known as Enhanced GS , also known as Stack Buffer Overrun Detection , which helps prevent stack buffer overruns by detecting stack corruption and avoiding execution if such corruption is encountered.Internet Explorer 8 used SmartScreen technology , which , according to Microsoft , was successful against phishing or other malicious sites and in blocking of socially engineered malware .
In Internet Explorer 9 , the protection against malware downloads is extended with SmartScreen Application Reputation .
This warns downloaders if they are downloading an application without a safe reputation from a site that does not have a safe reputation.In late 2010 , the results of browser malware testing undertaken by NSS labs were published .
The study looked at the browser 's capability to prevent users following socially engineered links of a malicious nature and downloading malicious software .
It did not test the browser 's ability to block malicious web pages or code.According to NSS , Internet Explorer 9 blocked 99 % of malware downloads compared to 90 % for Internet Explorer 8 that does not have SmartScreen Application Reputation feature .
In early 2010 , similar tests gave Internet Explorer 8 an 85 % passing grade , the 5 % improvement being attributed to " continued investments in improved data intelligence " .
By comparison , the same research showed that Chrome 6 , Firefox 3.6 and Safari 5 , which all rely on Google 's Safe Browsing Service , scored 6 % , 19 % and 11 % , respectively .
Opera 10 scored 0 % , failing to " detect any of the socially engineered malware samples " .
Manufacturers of other browsers criticized the test , focusing upon the lack of transparency of URLs tested and the lack of consideration of layered security additional to the browser , with Google commenting that " The report itself clearly states that it does not evaluate browser security related to vulnerabilities in plug-ins or the browsers themselves " , and Opera commenting that the results appeared " odd that they received no results from our data providers " and that " social malware protection is not an indicator of overall browser security " .
Internet Explorer 9 's dual-pronged approach to blocking access to malicious URLs -- SmartScreen Filter to block bad URLs , and Application Reputation to detect untrustworthy executables -- provides the best socially engineered malware blocking of any stable browser version .
Internet Explorer 9 blocked 92 percent of malware with its URL-based filtering , and 100 percent with Application-based filtering enabled .
Internet Explorer 8 , in second place , blocked 90 percent of malware .
Tied for third place were Safari 5 , Chrome 10 , and Firefox 4 , each blocking just 13 percent .
Bringing up the rear was Opera 11 , blocking just 5 percent of malware .
User agent string Due to technical improvements of the browser , the Internet Explorer developer team decided to change the user agent ( UA ) string .
The Mozilla/4 .0 token was changed to Mozilla/5 .0 to match the user agent strings of other recent browsers and to indicate that Internet Explorer 9 is more interoperable than previous versions .
The Trident/4 .0 token was likewise changed to Trident/5 .0 .
Because long , extended UA strings cause compatibility issues , Internet Explorer 9 's default UA string does not include .
NET identifiers or other " pre-platform " and " post-platform " tokens that were sent by previous versions of the browser .
The extended string is still available to websites via the browser 's .
userAgent property , and is sent when a web page is displayed in compatibility mode .
Extensibility In Internet Explorer 9 , the extensibility mechanisms for Browser Helper Objects ( BHOs ) and toolbars remain the same .
Not loading BHOs or toolbars improves startup time , but limits the ability of developers to augment the user experience through these extensibility mechanisms .
Removed features Separate search boxSecurity zone information and Protected Mode status , progress bar , and other status bar elements except for the Zoom buttonSupport for DirectX page transitionsPossibility to place the menubar above the addressbar Reception Release candidate A release candidate was launched on February 10 , 2011 in San Francisco .
New features since the last beta version were tracking protection and use of hardware accelerated graphics , and improvements included faster performance and more support for emerging HTML5 standards.Noting that according to Net Applications , Internet Explorer 's share fell to 56 % in January 2011 , the BBC quoted Microsoft 's claims that Internet Explorer 9 is " playing catch up , but it leapfrogs everything " and " you are seeing innovation after innovation that other folks are catching up to . "
In The Register , Tim Anderson said Internet Explorer 9 was Microsoft 's answer to the fall in Internet Explorer 's market share ( from 68.5 % in July 2008 to 46 % in January 2011 , according to StatCounter ) .
He felt it was " fast and polished " , a " remarkable improvement " over version 8 , noting " superb " development tools and " real and significant " support for HTML5 , though " not as comprehensive as the company 's publicity implies . "
However , configuration options are " strewn all over the user interface " , and the " distinctive and excellent " ActiveX filtering and Tracking Protection features might be " perplexing for less technical users . "
Having reached release candidate status eleven months after it was originally announced at the March 2010 MIX conference , " Microsoft 's development process is too slow . "
The new version is " a good modern browser " but " the competition is moving faster . "
Computing observed that " the feature set has piled up " since development began , with recent changes including " a completely rejigged JavaScript engine , and far better web standards support . "
It reported that Internet Explorer 9 RC ranked above Firefox , slightly above Safari , and below Chrome and Opera on Futuremark 's Peacekeeper browser benchmark .
Internet Explorer 9 scored 95 % on the unofficial Acid3 standards test.Michael Muchmore 's first impressions in PC Magazine were broadly positive , praising features of the InPrivate mode ( which " I 'm surprised other browser makers have n't included " ) and concluding that Internet Explorer 9 's tracking protection was " more flexible and comprehensive " than Mozilla 's .
The review reported that Internet Explorer 9 " now wins the SunSpider JavaScript Benchmark " and had achieved " a hefty improvement " on Google 's JavaScript benchmark -- though it was still far behind Chrome 9 .
However " in normal browsing , I was hard pressed to see a [ performance ] difference between Chrome and Internet Explorer . "
The release candidate was also " perfectly " compatible with far more sites than the beta , but there are still issues with some sites because their developers are not yet testing with the new browser .
The RC scores 4 out of 5 ( " very good " ) for now .
Final release On its first day of commercial availability , Internet Explorer 9 was downloaded over 2.35 million times.Blogging his March 2011 performance tests for ZDNet , Adrian Kingsley-Hughes concluded that Chrome 10 , Internet Explorer 9 ( 32-bit ) Final Release , Opera 11.01 and Firefox 4 's Release candidate were " pretty evenly matched ... .
Microsoft has worked hard on IE , taking it from being the slowest in the pack to one of the fastest .
Bottom line , I really do n’t think that JavaScript performance is an issue any more , and certainly in real-world testing it ’s hard to see a difference between the browsers . "
On 31 October 2011 , PC World ranked Internet Explorer 9 as # 19 on its 100 Best Products of 2011 .
The other web browser listed was Maxthon 3.1 , a hybrid browser based on Google Chrome and Internet Explorer .
A review of IE9 beta in PC World noted a performance improvement over IE8 .
Mobile version At the February 2011 Mobile World Congress , Steve Ballmer announced a major update to Windows Phone due towards the end of 2011 , which will include a mobile version of Internet Explorer 9 that supports the same web standards ( e.g. HTML5 ) and hardware accelerated graphics as the PC version .
Microsoft demonstrated hardware-accelerated performance of a fish-tank demo using a development build of mobile Internet Explorer 9 compared with slow performance on the November 2010 iOS 4.2.1 RTM of Safari on iPhone 4 .

Gallacher has been a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council since 1996 .
He was the Minister for the Hunter between 2011 and 2014 .
In May 2014 Gallacher resigned as Minister after being named in the Independent Commission Against Corruption for alleged involvement in a corrupt scheme to receive illegal political donations .
Early life and background Gallacher was born in Paisley , Scotland , and migrated with his parents to Australia as a young child .
He attended school at Lethbridge Park and Shalvey before completing his studies at Randwick Boys High School.He joined the NSW Police Force in 1980 and served as an officer in general duties , highway patrol , internal police investigations , criminal investigations and special operations .
He completed a Bachelor of Professional Studies through the University of New England in 1998 .
From 1991 to 1994 , Gallacher was a delegate to the New South Wales Police Association .
He was a senior lecturer in the Police Service 's Professional Responsibility Command and qualified for the Police Service Medal.Gallacher has lived and worked on the Central Coast for over 25 years .
He is actively involved in local surf life saving and is also a keen horseman .
Political career In 1996 Gallacher was appointed to the New South Wales Legislative Council , filling a casual vacancy caused by the resignation of Stephen Mutch.He first faced election at the 2003 state election and was re-elected .
In 2005 , he was appointed Shadow Minister for Police in the New South Wales Shadow Cabinet and was appointed the portfolio of Shadow Minister for the Hunter in April 2007 .

Charles Brodrick ( 3 May 1761 -- 6 May 1822 ) was a reforming Irish clergyman and Archbishop of Cashel in the Church of Ireland .
Origins and education Brodrick was the third son of the 3rd Viscount Midleton and Albinia Townshend , sister of Viscount Sydney .
He was educated , like his maternal uncle , at Clare Hall , Cambridge .
His brothers included George Brodrick , 4th Viscount Midleton and General John Brodrick.In 1787 he was ordained in Cloyne by the Bishop , his father-in-law , Richard Woodward , first deacon ( 24 August ) and then priest ( 9 December ) .
He was appointed Rector of Dingindonovan ( or Dangan ) and Prebendary of Killenemer , and established a reputation for himself by choosing to live in his remote parish " at a period when very lax notions prevailed respecting clerical residence " .
For a brief period in 1789 he was Prebendary of Donoughmore , before being appointed in June 1789 the Treasurer of Cloyne , where he served until 1795 .
In 1795 , Brodrick was consecrated as Bishop of Clonfert and Kilmacduagh , whence he was translated to Kilmore in 1796 .
In 1801 , following the preferment of Charles Agar to Dublin , Brodrick was appointed Archbishop of Cashel and Emly ( and Primate of Munster ) in his place and remained in that post until his death in 1822 , when he was succeeded by Richard Laurence .
From 1811 until 1820 , he also took on the administration of the diocese and province of Dublin , as a result of the mental incapacity of the Archbishop , Euseby Cleaver .
Assessment Brodrick was a committed ecclesiastical reformer .
One obituary following his death described him as " a prelate of distinguished piety , and of the most exemplary attention to the duties of his high station , as evinced by his increasing vigilance in enforcing the residence of the clergy , and by his disinterested appointments to the vacant livings " in his diocese .
Family and descendants On 8 December 1786 , Brodrick married Mary , the daughter of Richard Woodward , Bishop of Cloyne .
Of their children , Charles and William succeeded eventually as , respectively , the 6th Viscount Midleton and 7th Viscount Midleton ( the latter being also Dean of Exeter ) , while Mary married the Earl of Bandon and Albinia married James Ashley Maude .

In numerical analysis , the Schur complement method , named after Issai Schur , is the basic and the earliest version of non-overlapping domain decomposition method , also called iterative substructuring .
A finite element problem is split into non-overlapping subdomains , and the unknowns in the interiors of the subdomains are eliminated .
The remaining Schur complement system on the unknowns associated with subdomain interfaces is solved by the conjugate gradient method .
The method and implementation Suppose we want to solve the Poisson equation − Δ u = f , u | ∂ Ω = 0 { \ displaystyle - \ Delta u = f , \ qquad u | _ { \ partial \ Omega } = 0 } on some domain Ω .
When we discretize this problem we get an N-dimensional linear system AU = F .
The Schur complement method splits up the linear system into sub-problems .
To do so , divide Ω into two subdomains Ω1 , Ω2 which share an interface Γ .
Let U1 , U2 and UΓ be the degrees of freedom associated with each subdomain and with the interface .
We can then write the linear system as [ A 11 0 A 1 Γ 0 A 22 A 2 Γ A Γ 1 A Γ 2 A Γ Γ ] [ U 1 U 2 U Γ ] = [ F 1 F 2 F Γ ] , { \ displaystyle \ left [ { \ begin { matrix } A _ { 11 } & 0 & A _ { 1 \ Gamma } \ \ 0 & A _ { 22 } & A _ { 2 \ Gamma } \ \ A _ { \ Gamma 1 } & A _ { \ Gamma 2 } & A _ { \ Gamma \ Gamma } \ end { matrix } } \ right ] \ left [ { \ begin { matrix } U _ { 1 } \ \ U _ { 2 } \ \ U _ { \ Gamma } \ end { matrix } } \ right ] = \ left [ { \ begin { matrix } F _ { 1 } \ \ F _ { 2 } \ \ F _ { \ Gamma } \ end { matrix } } \ right ] , } where F1 , F2 and FΓ are the components of the load vector in each region.The Schur complement method proceeds by noting that we can find the values on the interface by solving the smaller system Σ U Γ = F Γ − A Γ 1 A 11 − 1 F 1 − A Γ 2 A 22 − 1 F 2 , { \ displaystyle \ Sigma U _ { \ Gamma } = F _ { \ Gamma } - A _ { \ Gamma 1 } A _ { 11 } ^ { -1 } F _ { 1 } - A _ { \ Gamma 2 } A _ { 22 } ^ { -1 } F _ { 2 } , } for the interface values UΓ , where we define the Schur complement matrix Σ = A Γ Γ − A Γ 1 A 11 − 1 A 1 Γ − A Γ 2 A 22 − 1 A 2 Γ .
{ \ displaystyle \ Sigma = A _ { \ Gamma \ Gamma } - A _ { \ Gamma 1 } A _ { 11 } ^ { -1 } A _ { 1 \ Gamma } - A _ { \ Gamma 2 } A _ { 22 } ^ { -1 } A _ { 2 \ Gamma } . }
The important thing to note is that the computation of any quantities involving A 11 − 1 { \ displaystyle A _ { 11 } ^ { -1 } } or A 22 − 1 { \ displaystyle A _ { 22 } ^ { -1 } } involves solving decoupled Dirichlet problems on each domain , and these can be done in parallel .
Consequently , we need not store the Schur complement matrix explicitly ; it is sufficient to know how to multiply a vector by it.Once we know the values on the interface , we can find the interior values using the two relations A 11 U 1 = F 1 − A 1 Γ U Γ , A 22 U 2 = F 2 − A 2 Γ U Γ , { \ displaystyle A _ { 11 } U _ { 1 } = F _ { 1 } - A _ { 1 \ Gamma } U _ { \ Gamma } , \ qquad A _ { 22 } U _ { 2 } = F _ { 2 } - A _ { 2 \ Gamma } U _ { \ Gamma } , } which can both be done in parallel.The multiplication of a vector by the Schur complement is a discrete version of the Poincaré -- Steklov operator , also called the Dirichlet to Neumann mapping .
Advantages There are two benefits of this method .
First , the elimination of the interior unknowns on the subdomains , that is the solution of the Dirichlet problems , can be done in parallel .
Second , passing to the Schur complement reduces condition number and thus tends to decrease the number of iterations .
For second-order problems , such as the Laplace equation or linear elasticity , the matrix of the system has condition number of the order 1/h2 , where h is the characteristic element size .
The Schur complement , however , has condition number only of the order 1/h .
For performances , the Schur complement method is combined with preconditioning , at least a diagonal preconditioner .
The Neumann -- Neumann method and the Neumann -- Dirichlet method are the Schur complement method with particular kinds of preconditioners .

Klub Foot was a highly influential London nightclub in the Psychobilly scene of the early and mid-1980s .
It started in the heyday of the pscyhobilly scene in 1982 .
It was hosted at the Clarendon Hotel in Hammersmith until was demolished as part of the redevelopment of Hammersmith Town Centre .
It regularly showcased the rising stars of the scene , including The Meteors , Demented Are Go , Guana Batz , Batmobile , Long Tall Texans , The Sting-Rays , The Caravans , Klingonz , Coffin Nails , Skitzo , The Highliners , Sgt Bilko 's Krazy Combo and many others .
On all the Klub Foot posters the address stated was " Clarendon Hotel Ballroom , Hammersmith Broadway W6 " .
The Clarendon itself was a very large 1930s Hotel with attached function rooms built in the Art Deco style , and it stood on the corner of the Hammersmith one way system until its demolition in 1988 .
The Klub Foot was held in the main ballroom on the first floor , which held around 900 people.As well as hosting concerts , the Klub Foot promoter released a series of live recordings , titled Stomping At The Klubfoot on ABC records .
Six volumes were released on vinyl and CD.After the Clarendon closed , attempts were made to relocate the club at various locations including the Boston Arms in Tufnell Park , and the Town and Country Club in Kentish Town , but the dying Psychobilly scene in the UK in the 1990s made it difficult to attract crowds .
Since 1999 , subsequent Klub Foot Reunion concerts at the Relentless Garage in Highbury have been more successful and it is now a yearly event featuring original 1980s bands with newer support acts .

William Wickham King ( 30 May 1862 -- 11 December 1959 ) , usually known as Wickham King was a distinguished amateur geologist , a Fellow of the Geological Society for 50 years.He was the younger son of William Henry King and followed him as a solicitor in Stourbridge and magistrates clerk for the Stourbridge and Kingswinford Petty Sessional Divisions.As a young man , he rowed with Bewdley rowing club , but came to grief one day when his penny-farthing bicycle broke under him .
He also climbed in the Alps and Cuillins , where King 's Chimney and King 's Cave Gully are named after him .
Wickham King was a prominent member of the London Alpine Club and the Scottish Mountaineering Club , joining the latter in 1891 .
He was a competent alpinist , with at least half of his ascents being made guideless.His interest in geology began when he found a fossil on the Clent Hills .
This led to his attending classes provided by Birmingham University .
His first published paper was on the Clent Breccia in 1893 .
This was followed by others on aspects of the Black Country or South Staffordshire Coalfield .
He also produced a plexographic map of the Thick Coal in it.His most important work was on the Old Red Sandstone , which was then believed to be barren of fossils .
His work on this in Shropshire and elsewhere , particularly at Earnstrey east of Brown Clee Hill led to him discovering fossils of a fish , named Corvaspis Kingi.His later papers included ' The Downtonian and Dittonian Strata of Great Britain and North-Western Europe ' Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society 90 ( 1934 ) , pp. 526ff .
At the beginning of the Second World War , he retired to Devon and continued his geological work there , including producing a 25-inch geological map of the Abberley area .
On completing this he gave his collections to Birmingham University , where they form part of the collections of the Lapworth Museum of Geology .
Awards In 1924 he was awarded the Lyell Medal by the Geological Society of London .
Birmingham University awarded him an honorary M.Sc .
degree , the unusual award .

Ad Sinarum gentem issued October 7 , 1954 , is an encyclical of Pope Pius XII to the Chinese people on the super-nationality of the Church .
Background The encyclical is written against the background of continued persecution of Christians in China , the expulsion of foreign missionaries , the jailing of domestic priests and lay people and the attempts by the State , to institute a national Chinese Catholic Church .
Three years earlier , the Pope had issued the apostolic letter Cupimus Imprimis to the Chinese people , to express his " sympathy in your afflictions , but also to exhort you paternally to fulfil all the duties of the Christian religion with that resolute fidelity that sometimes demands heroic strength " . "
Since that time , the conditions of the Catholic Church have not improved .
Accusations and calumnies against the Apostolic See , and those who keep themselves faithful to it , have increased .
The Apostolic Nuncio has been expelled .
Although the " great majority of Catholics have remained steadfast in the Faith , some adhered to dangerous movements from the enemies of all religion " .
The consciousness of Our duty demands that We once more direct Our words to you through this Encyclical Letter , with the hope that it can become known to you .
May it be of some comfort and encouragement for those who persevere staunchly and bravely in truth and virtue .
To the others may it bring light and Our paternal admonitions .
Message The Pope warns against separation from Rome , defends the Church against accusations of undermining Chinese culture and society , and welcomes cultural differences in preaching and teaching.The manner of preaching and teaching ought to differ according to place , and therefore ought to conform , when possible , to the nature and particular character of the Chinese people , and also to its ancient traditional customs .
If this is properly done , certainly greater fruits will be gathered among you .
But - and it is absurd merely to think of it - by what right can men arbitrarily and diversely in different nations , interpret the Gospel of Jesus Christ ?
This pastoral flexibility can not imply however , that the Church agrees to political theology or a specific Chinese Christianity .

This process ceased in about 1950 when the local council earmarked the area for housing development.The land at Russells Hall was then made safe and allowed to settle until house building commenced .
The first council house was occupied in 1958 and the whole estate was completed within a decade , with a mix of private and council housing .
The estate is served by a primary school , a secondary school and three special schools , as well as being within close proximity of the local hospital .
The Russells Hall Estate The Russells Hall Estate is a residential area of Dudley , West Midlands , England .
Situated approximately one mile to the west of Dudley town centre , the site was earmarked for development as council housing in around 1950 , to rehouse hundreds of families from the dilapidated 19th century terraces which were still standing in the town centre around The Inhedge and Stafford Street.The site of the Russells Hall Estate had been extensively mined for coal since the late 18th century , and after the land was made level it had to be left to settle for five years before any homes could be built .
Local industrialisation had been considerable , as the district had become highly industrialised in the then heyday of the Black Country 's industrial past.The first house was completed and let in 1958 , and by 1966 the estate was complete , consisting of several hundred council houses and flats as well as some private houses , mostly situated around Scott ’s Green Close on the south side of the estate .
Several more private and council properties , including about 30 council bungalows , were added in the 1970s around Middlepark Road .
Schools The estate is served by several schools including Russells Hall Primary School on Overfield Road and the Holly Hall Academy on Scotts Green Close .
Sutton School is a special school which is also located on Scotts Green Close .
Local amenities Russells Hall Hospital , a general hospital which stands on Pensnett Road to the south of the estate .
Parks and recreational areas A large area of public open space exists around the centre of the estate and in 2005 was earned by Dudley council as a possible site for mass housing development .

Military history in the year 1900 .
The Martin NBS-1 was a military aircraft of the United States Army Air Service and its successor , the Air Corps .
An improved version of the Martin MB-1 , a scout-bomber built during the final months of World War I , the NBS-1 was ordered under the designation MB-2 and is often referred to as such .
The designation NBS-1 , standing for " Night Bomber-Short Range " , was adopted by the Air Service after the first five of the Martin bombers were delivered.The NBS-1 became the standard frontline bomber of the Air Service in 1920 and remained so until its replacement in 1928 -- 1929 by the Keystone Aircraft series of bombers .
The basic MB-2 design was also the standard against which prospective U.S. Army bombers were judged until the production of the Martin B-10 in 1933 .
Design and development The NBS-1 was a wood-and-fabric biplane without staggered wings , employing twin rudders on a twin vertical tail .
Its two Liberty 12-A engines sat in nacelles on the lower wing , flanking the fuselage .
Ordered under the company designation MB-2 in June 1920 , the NBS-1 was an improved larger version of the Martin MB-1 bomber built by the Glenn L. Martin Company in 1918 , also known as the GMB or Glenn Martin Bomber .
The first flight of the MB-2 took place 3 September 1920 .
In addition to more powerful engines , larger wings and fuselage , and simplified landing gear , the NBS-1 also had a unique folding wing system , hinged outside the engine nacelles to fold backwards for storage in small hangars .
Unlike the MB-1 , whose engines were mounted between the wings in a fashion similar to the German Staaken R.VI Riesenflugzeug , the engines of the NBS-1 were fixed to the lower wing over the landing gear.The MB-2 was designed as a night bomber and except for a greater load capacity , had reduced performance characteristics compared to its MB-1 predecessor .
The first 20 ( five MB-2s and 15 NBS-1s ) were ordered from the Martin Company , which recommended a further 50 be produced to help its struggling financial condition .
However the design was owned by the U.S. Army and subsequent contracts for 110 bombers were awarded by low bid to three other companies : Lowe Willard and Fowler Engineering Company of College Point , New York ( 35 ordered ) , Curtiss Aircraft ( 50 ) , and Aeromarine Plane and Motor Company of Keyport , New Jersey ( 25 ) .
The engines of the last 20 bombers of the Curtiss order came equipped with turbosuperchargers manufactured by General Electric , the first such modification made in production quantity .
Although enabling the NBS-1 to reach an altitude of over 25,000 ft ( 7,650 m ) , the turbosuperchargers were mechanically unreliable and not used operationally.The bomber was equipped defensively with five .30 in ( 7.62 mm ) Lewis Guns , mounted in pairs in positions in the nose and upper rear fuselage , and singly in a bottom mount , firing behind and beneath the rear fuselage.The first two Martin MB-2s , Air Service serials 64195 and 64196 , were retained at McCook Field in Dayton , Ohio , for R&D flight testing , marked with project numbers ' P162 ' and ' P227 ' respectively , as was the second NBS-1 , 64201 , marked as ' P222 ' .
Four Curtiss NBS-1s were also assigned to McCook .
Operational history The NBS-1 was the primary bomber used by Brigadier General Billy Mitchell during Project B , the demonstration bombing of naval ships in July 1921 .
Six NBS-1 bombers , led by Captain Walter Lawson of the 96th Squadron operating out of Langley Field , bombed and sank the captured German battleship SMS Ostfriesland on 21 July 1921 , using specially developed 2,000 lb ( 907 kg ) demolition bombs , externally mounted beneath the fuselage .

In 2002 , however , a full-scale reproduction went on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton , Ohio , constructed from original drawings.An example of the plane was featured in director William Wellman 's 1927 Paramount silent film Wings , disguised as a German Gotha bomber .
Footage was shot overhead of the MB-2 as it exited its tent hangar and from the MB-2 during flight .
These aerial shots were revolutionary at the time , showing the public a perspective of aerial combat from the pilots ' point of view .
Wings won the first-ever Academy Award for best picture .

Notes
E.H. Hurst ( ) was a dairy farmer and politician in Mississippi , elected as a Democrat to the Mississippi House of Representatives in the 1950s-1960s .
He supported segregation and opposed the civil rights movement , which expanded in the early 1960s .
Hurst is noted for killing Herbert Lee on September 25 , 1961 , and gaining a verdict of self-defense that day from the all-white jury at the inquest .
Lee was an African-American man who was trying to register voters in Liberty , Mississippi , the small hometown of both men .
Event E.H. Hurst was born and raised in Liberty , Mississippi.As a state politician , elected as a Democrat , Hurst supported segregation and the continued exclusion of blacks from voting in the state .
They had been disfranchised by the 1890 state constitution and discriminatory practices related to voter registration .
He opposed the civil rights movement , which had begun to try to register African-American voters.On September 25 , 1961 , Hurst shot and killed Herbert Lee ( 1909-1961 ) , a 52-year-old married man with nine children , who participated in voter registration classes and had volunteered to register to vote .
He had been a charter member of the NAACP in the county and had joined the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee ( SNCC ) campaign in Mississippi .
At the inquest the same day , an all-white jury returned a verdict of justifiable homicide , on the grounds of self-defense .
The Amite County courtroom was full of armed white men , and witnesses were pressured to testify in Hurst 's favor.Medgar Evers , leader of the NAACP in Mississippi , was one of the speakers at Lee 's funeral .
In June 1963 he was shot in the back outside his home in a political assassination and died soon after , killed by a KKK member.Louis Allen , a black witness to Lee 's being shot , discussed his case with SNCC civil rights activists including Julian Bond .
Learning that a federal jury was considering charges against Hurst , Allen met with representatives of the FBI and Civil Rights Commission to see if he could get federal protection if he were to testify .
When the Justice Department told him they could not offer him protection , he decided to stick to his story .
People in the white community heard he had talked to the government , however , and threats were made against him .
He was economically blackmailed , lost his job , and harassed by law enforcement.In January 1964 , the night before he was planning to move away from Liberty , Allen was murdered in his driveway by two shot-gun blasts .
Investigations since 1994 have suggested that Allen was murdered by Daniel Jones , the Amite County sheriff , but no one has been prosecuted for his murder.Activists were able to register about 1200 voters against the resistance of officials in Mississippi .
But , in a simple process that was typical of northern states and to show the desire of blacks to vote , they registered thousands of blacks , and organized the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party , open to all .
Sixty thousand blacks joined this party , and elected 68 delegates to go to the national Democratic convention in Atlantic City , New Jersey that summer .
They challenged the white-only Democratic Party delegates at the credentials committee , as white Democrats in the South had kept most blacks out of politics for more than 60 years .

Miller encouraged McIntyre to start his own group again , and the McIntyre Orchestra first played in New Rochelle , New York in 1941 ; the ensemble included vocalists Gloria Van , Ruth Gaylor , and Al Nobel , bassist Eddie Safranski , and saxophonist Allen Eager .
They played many major ballrooms throughout the United States , and played overseas for troops during World War II .
He toured extensively with songstress Sunny Gale until the summer of ' 51 .
He maintained the orchestra into the 1950s , backing The Mills Brothers for their 1952 smash hit " Glow Worm " .
He co-wrote the song " Daisy Mae " with Billy May which was recorded by Glenn Miller and His Orchestra.McIntyre was critically injured in an apartment fire in 1959 , and died at a hospital a few days later .
His , son , Hal Jr. ( dec 'd ) , was a talented saxophone and clarinet player who attended Berklee College of Music in the 1960s .
In the 1970s , Hal Jr ran a big band in the Boston area , playing many of the original McIntyre Orchestra arrangements .
He is survived by his daughter Patricia .
Radio Beginning January 2 , 1945 , McIntyre and his orchestra had a weekly broadcast on the Blue Network .
One feature of the program was that on each program the orchestra would " play the theme song of one of America 's college fraternities as a salute to some member of that fraternity who has distinguished himself in the war effort . "

Lewis Yelland Andrews ( 1896-1937 ) was the British District Commissioner for the Galilee during the British Mandate for Palestine .
He was assassinated by Arab gunmen on his way to prayer services at Anglican Christ Church in Nazareth on 26 September 1937 .
Biography Lewis Yelland Andrews was a son of A.E. Andrews from Sydney , Australia .
Andrews had fought in World War I for the Australian Imperial Forces .
He later served as British district commissioner for Galilee .
His assassination on 26 September 1937 , caused Britain to respond by outlawing the Arab Higher Committee and the arresting of its members .
His assassination was considered to represent the apex of the great Arab revolt in Palestine.Before his murder , one of Andrews ' last tasks was to organise a program for the Royal Commission .
He allegedly used his influence in favour of partition of the British Mandate .
He was the object of particular hatred among Palestinians in the Galilee area for the manner in which he carried out repressive measures after the outbreak of the general strike of 1936 .
On 26 September 1937 , Andrews , Pirie-Gordon ( the assistant district commissioner ) and Andrews ' bodyguard ( a British police constable ) were on their way from attending service at the Anglican Christ Church , Nazareth when they were gunned down by 4 masked militant followers of Izz ad-Din al-Qassam .
Andrews died on the spot and the bodyguard later died at the hospital.Britain immediately issued a warrant for the arrest of Hajj Amin al-Husayni .
Shortly afterwards the Arab Higher Committee , of which al-Husayni was chairman , was declared illegal , and a warrant was made out for Husayni 's arrest .
Al-Husayni holed up in the Haram al-Sharif for some time and eventually slipped out under cover of dark and eventually made his way to Syria which became the committee 's new base of operations .
In the absence of the established leadership , more radical politicians assumed control of the resistance movement within Palestine itself .
Anti-Zionist and anti-British attacks rapidly increased , as did British repression.Andrews was buried in Jerusalem and his grave is preserved in the Protestant Mount Zion Cemetery there .
He left a widow and three children .

Dudding Hill railway station was a station in Neasden , London NW2 on the Dudding Hill Line.The station was opened in 1875 by the Midland Railway , originally as " Dudding Hill , for Willesden & Neasden " .
It closed to passengers in 1902 , despite providing access to the neighbouring new Gladstone Park , and goods services ceased in 1964 .
Although the platforms were demolished , the station building survived into the 1980s , when the land was used for housing ( Cornmow Drive was built on the site ) .
The Dudding Hill Line offers a connection between the North London Line at Acton and the Midland Main Line at Brent Cross and Cricklewood .
It is now only used for freight , but has recently been incorporated into the proposed North and West London Light Railway .

Bogislaw IV ( Polish : Bogusław IV ; died 19 February 1309 or 24 February 1309 ) , of the Griffins dynasty , was Duke of Pomerania for thirty years.Bogislaw was the eldest son of Duke Barnim I by his first wife , sometimes said to be a daughter of King Eric X of Sweden .
He was an adult at his father 's death in 1278 , having been co-ruler since 1276 .
His half-brothers Barnim II and Otto I were still very young and so he was sole ruler in Pomerania during their minority.In the early 1280s Bogislaw was involved in the war in the neighbouring margraviate of Brandenburg .
At this time he married Matilda , daughter of John I and a sister of reigning Margrave Otto IV , but all of his known children were by a second marriage to Margarete , daughter of Wizlaw II , Prince of Rügen.In the 1290s with his brothers now adults , Pomerania was divided between them with Bogislaw receiving Wolgast as his share .
Barnim II died soon afterwards and Otto ruled Szczecin.In the 14th century , he was allied with would-be King of Poland Władysław the Short .
He was unsuccessfully involved in the opening stages of the decade-long Brandenburg War .
He died in 1309 leaving his share of Pomerania to his son Wartislaw .
Marriage and issue He firstly married Matilda of Brandenburg-Stendal , daughter of John I , Margrave of Brandenburg .
He married secondly Margarete of Rügen , daughter of Wizlaw II , Prince of Rügen .
His children from his second marriage were : Euphemia of Pomerania married Christopher II of DenmarkWartislaw IV , Duke of Pomerania , would later rule in Western Pomerania and inherit RügenElisabeth of Pomerania ( 1291 -- 1349 ) married Duke Eric I of Saxe-Lauenburg ca. 1318JuttaMargareta , wife of Nicholas I , Lord of Rostockpossibly another daughter , Euphemia , wife of Adolph V , Count of Holstein-Segeberg See also List of Pomeranian duchies and dukesHistory of PomeraniaDuchy of PomeraniaHouse of Pomerania References Adolf Häckermann ( 1876 ) , " Bogislav IV " , Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie ( ADB ) ( in German ) , 3 , Leipzig : Duncker & Humblot , pp. 42 -- 43 Roderich Schmidt ( 1955 ) , " Bogislaw IV .

Thimo I , Count of Wettin ( c. 1015 -- 9 March 1090/1091 or c. 1100 ) , a member of the Wettin dynasty , was Count of Wettin and Brehna .
LifeEdit He was a younger son of Margrave Theodoric II , Margrave of Lower Lusatia and his wife Mathilda , a daughter of Margrave Eckard I of Meissen .
When his father was killed in 1034 , Thimo succeeded him in his Wettin and Brehna home territories .
He also served as Vogt ( bailiff ) of the Naumburg diocese and of the Wettin family monastery in Gerbstedt.In the Saxon Rebellion of 1073 -- 75 , he fought against King Henry IV and also quarreled with his brother Bishop Frederick of Münster .
Later he again approached the king and in 1088 attended the Hoftag diet in Quedlinburg , where the Brunonid margrave Egbert II of Meissen was deposed.The exact year of Thimo 's death is unclear ; since his son Conrad was born in approximately 1098 , Thimo can not have died long before this year .
Alternatively , some researchers assume that Thimo was in fact Conrad 's grandfather , and that Conrad 's father was an unknown son of Thimo 's with the same name , making a death year of 1090/91 possible , as given in a chronicle .
However , since Thimo II is not otherwise attested , this is considered unlikely.He is buried at the monastery of Niemegk , which he had founded .
Marriage and childrenEdit Thimo married Ida , daughter of Count Otto of Nordheim .
Together they had three children : Dedi IV ( died 16 December 1124 ) , Count of Wettin , married Berta , daughter of Margrave Wiprecht of Groitzsch , died without male heirsConrad , Margrave of Meissen ( c. 1097 -- 1157 ) Mathilde , married Count Gero I of Seeburg in 1115 , and secondly Count Louis of Wippra in 1123 ReferencesEdit
Cream skimming is a pejorative conceptual metaphor used to refer to the perceived business practice of a company providing a product or a service to only the high-value or low-cost customers of that product or service , while disregarding clients that are less profitable for the company.The term derives from the practice of extracting cream from fresh milk at a dairy , in which a separator draws off the cream ( which is lighter , and floats ) from fresh or raw milk .
The cream has now been " skimmed " or captured separately from the fresh milk.The idea behind the concept of cream skimming in business is that the " cream " -- high value or low-cost customers , who are more profitable to serve -- would be captured by some suppliers ( typically by charging less than the previous higher prices , but still making a profit ) , leaving the more expensive or harder to service customers without the desired product or service at all or " dumping " them on some default provider , who is left with less of the higher value customers who , in some cases , would have provided extra revenue to subsidize or reduce the cost to service the higher-cost customers , and the loss of the higher value customers might actually require the default provider to have to raise prices to cover the lost revenue , thus making things worse.Whether or not the perceived negative effects of cream skimming actually do occur -- or only occur in limited circumstances -- is a matter of judgment and debate .
Examples The term has been used in relation to the concept of school vouchers in which it is claimed that the vouchers could be used by parents of " better " students ( i.e. , students with above average grades who are not disciplinary risks ) to move them out of lower performing or substandard state schools and into less-crowded private ones , leaving the " worse " students ( i.e. , students with learning disabilities or who are troublemakers ) behind in the state schools , making the situation worse.For example , it was believed that MCI and Sprint long distance telephone companies would end up taking away very high value business and some residential accounts from AT&T , leaving AT&T primarily with higher-cost to service accounts or ones producing less revenue ( such as customers in less-densely populated or rural areas ) , meaning all customers of AT&T would end up paying more .
This could conceivably lead to a vicious circle as more customers leave the high-price carrier for the lower priced carrier , thus forcing still more price increases to cover the upward spiraling costs of providing service to a shrinking revenue base .
This scenario did not occur , as various technological changes ( spurred in part by the availability of competition ) eventually lowered the net cost for most long-distance telephone calls.The United States Postal Service has a monopoly on the delivery of " non-urgent " first-class mail , where delivery is not time-sensitive .
It also has the exclusive right to use customer-owned mail boxes for placing the customer 's mail for delivery .
This means that , even though mail boxes , such as those in the door of a house , or on the curb , or in the front lobby of the customer 's building , are owned by the customer , and not owned by the Postal Service , by law only the Postal Service may use them to deliver mail .
This law is in effect because it is believed that were the Postal Service to not have this monopoly , other competing mail carriers would take over the most lucrative parts of the business ( e.g. local delivery of bills in dense urban areas ) , leaving the Postal Service with more expensive urban deliveries and rural service .

In addition to his interests in complex systems and computer science , he is a member of the Royal Entomological Society and an expert in the rearing and ecology of hawk moths .
He is also currently co-ordinator of the technology special interest group ( SIG ) for the Royal Entomological Society.He is also interested in the use of precision agriculture methodologies to monitor agri-ecosystems , and has been an active participant in a series of projects looking at the automatic tracking of bumblebees , and other insects using vision , and using both network analysis and remote sensing techniques to monitor ecosystem health .
Latterly , he has become interested in applying these techniques in the commercial sphere to look at issues of corporate responsibility and sustainability in industries like mining and agriculture which have significant ecological footprints.He has also been involved in both computational neuroscience and systems biology , the former association resulting in many papers while working at Oxford University .
Work in the latter area led to the successful flotation in 2007 of a systems biology company , e-Therapeutics , where O'Neill was a senior scientist , assisted with the establishment of the company , and was named in a number of seminal patents.O ' Neill is a fellow of the British Computer Society , the Institute of Engineering and Technology , and the Royal Astronomical Society .
He is also a chartered engineer and a chartered IT professional .
He was one of the recipients of the BCS Award for Computing Technology in 1992 .

In parliamentary procedure , a motion to postpone to a certain time ( or postpone definitely or postpone ) is used to delay action on a pending question until a different day , meeting , hour or until after a certain event .
Then , when that time comes , the consideration of the question is picked up where it was left off when it was postponed .
Explanation and use Using Robert 's Rules of Order Newly Revised ( RONR ) , action on a pending question may be postponed to another time .
Alternatively , a motion can be postponed until after a specific event has occurred , such as after an officer makes a relevant report .
A postponed question becomes an order of the day ( a general order or a special order in the order of business ) for the time to which it is postponed .
Postponing a motion is permitted so long as : There is a meeting on the date the motion is postponed to .
For example , a main motion can not be postponed to a day where there is no regular meeting or where a special meeting has not been planned yet.The date to which the main motion is being postponed is not too late for it to be effective .
For example , if the main motion proposes that there be a picnic on September 3 , the motion can not be postponed to September 5 , because that would be too late for it to be carried out.Under Demeter 's Manual , if a motion to postpone definitely specifies a time that falls after the next regular meeting , or after a certain event which will not occur until after the next regular meeting , then it is treated as a motion to postpone indefinitely , which effectively ends consideration of the pending question.A motion to postpone an action or event that was previously scheduled is distinct from the subsidiary motion to postpone to a certain time , and is a type of the motion to amend something previously adopted.Generally , a motion to postpone is applied to a main motion and not to other motions alone.Debate on the motion to postpone to a certain time should be brief and confined only to the reasons for and time of the postponement .
Amendments to it may only relate to the desired date that the assembly will resume consideration or if the question is to be a special order.The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure ( TSC ) treats the motion to postpone to a certain time similar to that in RONR .
A difference is that TSC does not allow this motion to be reconsidered .
Improper use of tabling a motion Frequently , a motion is improperly " tabled " until the next meeting .
In this case , the proper procedure would have been to postpone the motion to the next meeting .

Carol Hoorn Fraser ( 1930 -- 1991 ) was an American-born figurative artist who worked for thirty years in Nova Scotia , Canada , with a commitment to life values , a distrust of what George Orwell called smelly little orthodoxies , and a belief in craftsmanship as the best enabler of creative individuation .
Biographical Details Carol Hoorn Fraser was born on September 5 , 1930 , in Depression-era Superior , Wisconsin .
Her father , Arvid Hoorn , was a Swedish-American Lutheran pastor who built the family home and three churches with his own hands .
Her mother , Hazel , from an English tradition , did exquisite needlework , had an M.A. in Home Economics , and supported the family after Rev. Hoorn died of cancer in 1945 .
Carol attended Gustavus Adolphus College in Minnesota , graduating in 1951 with a major in chemistry and biology and a minor in art and literature .
After a year as a research chemist at Archer Daniels Midland in St. Paul , she audited theology lectures at the University of Göttingen , Germany ( 1952 -- 53 ) , and then worked for a year as a nurse 's aide in the cancer recovery ward at the University Hospital in Minneapolis .
During this time she took extension classes and earned enough credits to be accepted into the Master of Fine Arts program at the University of Minnesota , from which she graduated in 1959 with a minor in Philosophy and a 125-page thesis on " The Human Image in Contemporary Painting " .
She was Lorenz Eitner ’s course assistant and took classes from Malcolm Myers , John Hospers , and Allen Tate , among others .
Van Gogh and Käthe Kollwitz were particular heroes of hers .
She exhibited widely in the Twin Cities.She married Ph.D. student John Fraser in 1956 and , in 1961 , when he accepted a job in the Dalhousie University English Department , moved with him to Halifax , Nova Scotia , where she was to spend the rest of her life , with time in Provence and Mexico .
In 1977 she developed asthma and hyper-allergic sensitivities because of urea formaldehyde foam insulation .
Her career as an artist spanned more than thirty years .
During this time she produced a large body of figurative work using a variety of media .
In the later 1960s she moved away from a modified Expressionism to a hard-edged organicism with ongoing ecological themes .
In the 1980s she did a series of over a hundred strong-hued symbolical watercolours .
She was an avid gardener.From 1964 to 1969 she taught drawing part-time at the School of Architecture at the Technical University of Nova Scotia .
During the Seventies she curated a show of Expressionist prints and was Acting Director of the Dalhousie University Art Gallery for a year , curating the Fourth Dalhousie Drawing Exhibition in 1979 .

She believed in clarity in art-discourse , and practiced it herself .
She died at her home in Halifax on April 3 , 1991 , of cancer of the lungs .
A Frida Kahlo calendar was on the wall beside her bed .

Henry Harriman ( June 9 , 1804 -- May 17 , 1891 ) was one of the First Seven Presidents of the Seventy of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints from 1838 until his death .
The town of Herriman , Utah was named after him .
Biography Harriman was born in Rowley , Essex County , Massachusetts to Enoch Harriman and Sarah Brocklebank .
In 1832 , he was baptized a member of the Latter Day Saint church by Orson Hyde.Harriman moved to Kirtland , Ohio in 1834 and was a member of Zion 's Camp later that year .
In February 1838 , he became one of the Seven Presidents of the Seventy .
That same year , Harriman was one of the leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints who moved from Kirtland to Daviess County , Missouri in the Kirtland Camp .
He then moved with the Saints to Nauvoo , Illinois .
He was a Mormon pioneer and in 1849 , he settled at Fort Harriman in Utah Territory with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ( LDS Church ) and was the leader of the church members there so the settlement was named in his honor .
The spelling of the town 's name was later changed to " Herriman " .
In 1857 , Harriman was the president of the missionary handcart company that went east from Salt Lake City .
After leading this company , he then went to Great Britain where he served as a missionary , but the Utah War caused him and other missionaries to return home early.From 1882 until his death , Harriman was the Senior President of the Seventy .

There have been three baronetcies created for persons with the surname Clayton , two in the Baronetage of Great Britain and one in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom .
One creation is extant as of 2008 .

His grandson , the ninth/fifth Baronet , assumed in 1932 by deed poll the surname of Clayton-East-Clayton in lieu of Clayton-East .
However , on his early death the same year the line of the second son of the fourth Baronet failed and the baronetcy of Hall Place became extinct .
The late Baronet was succeeded in the baronetcy of Marden Park by his second cousin twice removed , the tenth Baronet .
He was the son of Sir FitzRoy Augustus Talbot Clayton , son of Reverend Augustus Philip Clayton , fifth and youngest son of the fourth Baronet .
As of 2008 the title is held by the tenth Baronet 's grandson , the twelfth Baronet , who succeeded his father in 1985 .
The Clayton Baronetcy , of Adlington in the County Palatine of Lancaster , was created in the Baronetage of Great Britain on 19 May 1774 for Richard Clayton , with remainder , failing heirs male of his own , to the heirs male of his father .
Clayton notably served as British Consul in Nantes and as a Recorder of Wigan .
He died without male issue and was succeeded according to the special remainder by his younger brother , the second Baronet .
He was childless and on his death in 1839 the baronetcy became extinct.The Clayton-East , later Gilbert-East , later Clayton-East-Clayton Baronetcy , of Hall Place in the County of Berkshire , was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 17 August 1838 for East Clayton-East .
Born East Clayton , he was the second son of the fourth Baronet of the 1732 creation and his wife Mary , daughter of Sir William East , 1st Baronet , of Hall Place , a title which had become extinct on the death of the latter 's son , the second Baronet in 1828 ( see East baronets ) .
East Clayton succeeded to the East estates on the death of his uncle in 1828 and assumed the following year the additional surname of East .
In 1838 the baronetcy of Hall Place was revived in his favour .
He was succeeded by his eldest son , the second Baronet .
In 1839 he assumed for his lifetime only by Royal licence the surname of Gilbert-East in lieu of Clayton-East .

Kiz is a ghost town located in arid Clark Valley , in the sparsely populated eastern part of Carbon County , Utah , United States .
This agricultural settlement existed between approximately 1906 and 1940 .
The nearest currently inhabited town is East Carbon .
History The area was first settled in the 1890s by two successive ranchers -- the first , by the name of Clark , giving his name to the valley .
Each of them in turn soon abandoned his ranch , most likely due to drought conditions .
In 1906 the first of the more permanent settlers arrived , Orson Dimick and John Higginson , later to be joined by Nephi Perkins and Dimick 's parents , Ephraim and Kiziah .
Most of the homesteaders came in the period 1910 -- 1916 , including a successful Basque sheepherder named Gratien Etchebarne who filed the first legal claim to the land in 1916 .
By then there were some two dozen families living in what became Kiz.The settlers were aware of the valley 's forbidding desert climate .
They set about the difficult task of dry farming .
Trying to save all the available water , residents dug numerous wells , and although there was no stream nearby , they built a large reservoir for irrigation.In 1921 the American Legion promoted Clark Valley as a home for World War I veterans to establish themselves , making claims of available irrigation water that never actually arrived .
It is not known how many people this advertisement brought , but by 1924 there were enough children to establish a school , in a building provided by Etchebarne .
The population reached its peak in 1925 , and a post office was established in 1926 in George Mead 's general store .
He suggested the name Kiz in honor of the first woman settler in the valley , his sister Kiziah " Aunt Kiz " Dimick.Kiz did experience successful harvests some years , but water was always in short supply .
In 1930 there was another severe drought , and most of the residents moved away .
The school burned down in 1932 , and the students started attending school in Sunnyside .
By 1940 Kiz was a ghost town .
The town 's cemetery and a few empty foundations are still visible .

Following the Islamic Revolution , Iran 's banking system was transformed to be run on an Islamic interest-free basis .
As of 2010 there were seven large government-run commercial banks .
As of March 2014 , Iran 's banking assets made up over a third of the estimated total of Islamic banking assets globally .
They totaled 17,344 trillion rials , or US$ 523 billion at the free market exchange rate , using central bank data , according to Reuters.Since 2001 the Iranian Government has moved toward liberalising the banking sector , although progress has been slow .
In 1994 Bank Markazi ( the central bank ) authorised the creation of private credit institutions , and in 1998 authorised foreign banks ( many of whom had already established representative offices in Tehran ) to offer full banking services in Iran 's free-trade zones .
The central bank sought to follow this with the recapitalisation and partial privatisation of the existing commercial banks , seeking to liberalise the sector and encourage the development of a more competitive and efficient industry .
State-owned banks are considered by many to be poorly functioning as financial intermediaries .
Extensive regulations are in place , including controls on rates of return and subsidized credit for specific regions .
The banking sector in Iran is viewed as a potential hedge against the removal of subsidies , as the plan is not expected to have any direct impact on banks.As of 2008 , demand for investment banking services was limited .
The economy remains dominated by the state ; mergers and acquisitions are infrequent and tend to take place between state players , which do not require advice of an international standard .
The capital markets are at an early stage of development . "
Privatization " through the bourse has tended to involve the sale of state-owned enterprises to other state actors .
There is also a lack of sizeable independent private companies that could benefit from using the bourse to raise capital .
As of 2009 , there was no sizeable corporate bond market .
Electronic banking in Iran is developing rapidly .
The needed $ 70 million initial capital for the opening of each electronic bank as approved by the Money and Credit Council compares with $ 200 million required to establish a private bank in the country .
History In 1960 the Central Bank of Iran ( CBI , also known as Bank Markazi ) was established as a banker for the government , with responsibility for issuing currency .
In 1972 legislation further defined the CBI ’s functions as a central bank responsible for national monetary policy .
In the 1960s and 1970s , the expansion of economic activity fueled by oil revenues increased Iran ’s financial resources , and subsequently the demand for banking services increased exponentially .
By 1977 , some 36 banks ( 24 commercial and 12 specialized ) with 8,275 branches were in operation .
Their topline revenue has always been trade finance and letters of credit.After the Revolution , the government nationalized domestic private banks and insurance companies .
Bank law was changed under new interest-free Islamic banking regulations .
The post-Revolution reduction in economic activity and financial resources required banks to consolidate .
By 1982 , this consolidation , in conformity with the Banking Nationalization Act , had reduced the number of banks to nine ( six commercial and three specialized ) and the number of branches to 6,581 .
Subsequently , the system expanded gradually.The government began to privatize the banking sector in 2001 when licenses were issued to two new privately owned banks.In 2011 , seven state-owned and private Iranian banks were involved in a USD 2.8-billion embezzlement case , which involved forging documents to secure multibillion-dollar loans and purchase state-owned companies.In 2014 , Iranian authorities arrested 12 people for embezzlement of more than $ 4.5 billion ( 3.6 billion euros ) from the Kerman branch of Tejarat Bank from 2009 until their arrest in 2013 .
Types of financial institutions As of 2011 , about 80 % of the country 's wealth was deposited with state banks and the remaining 20 % with private banks .
Iran 's financial institutions are : BanksFinance & Credit Institutions " Gharzolhasaneh " Funds ( Islamic non-profit granting funds - replicate many of the functions of smaller-scale credit providers ) Islamic banking In theory , Iranian banks use " provisional " interest-based transactions but retain the accounting standards of conventional banking .
In 2009 , Iranian banks accounted for about 40 percent of total assets of the world 's top 100 Islamic banks .
Three of the leading four Islamic banks are based there ; Bank Melli Iran , with assets of $ 45.5 billion came first , followed by Saudi Arabia 's Al-Rajhi Bank , Bank Mellat with $ 39.7 billion and Bank Saderat Iran with $ 39.3 billion .
“ Iranian banks are still the predominant Islamic banking players , holding seven out of the top 10 ranks and 12 of the 100 , ” the Asian Banker research group reported .
According to CIMB Group Holdings , Islamic finance is the fastest-growing segment of the global financial system and sales of Islamic bonds were predicted to rise by 24 percent to $ 25 billion in 2010 .
Yet , most of Iran 's financial resources are directed at trading , smuggling and speculation instead of production and manufacturing .
Commercial banks Commercial banks are authorized to accept checking and savings deposits and term investment deposits , and they are allowed to use promotional methods to attract deposits .
Term investment deposits may be used by banks in a variety of activities such as joint ventures , direct investments , and limited trade partnerships ( except to underwrite imports ) .
However , commercial banks are prohibited from investing in the production of luxury and nonessential consumer goods .
Commercial banks also may engage in authorized banking operations with state-owned institutions , government-affiliated organizations , and public corporations .
The funds received as commissions , fees , and returns constitute bank income and can not be divided among depositors .
According to the Central Bank of Iran , the financial sector has about $ 260 billion of liquidity , or 65 % of the GDP of Iran ’s economy .
Derivatives market As of 2009 , the Iranian oil bourse was a spot market for petrochemical products mainly , with plans to introduce sharia-compliant futures contracts for crude oil and petrochemicals in the future .
Trading takes place through licensed private brokers registered with the Securities and Exchange Organization of Iran .
With help of Bahrain-based International Islamic Financial Market and New York-based International Swaps and Derivatives Association , global standards for Islamic derivatives were set in 2010 .
The “ Hedging Master Agreement ” provides a structure under which institutions can trade derivatives such as profit-rate and currency swaps .
While the standards of the Bahrain-based Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions ( AAOIFI ) are widely followed around the world , they are not enforced in Iran .
Rates As of 2010 , the interest rate charged between banks ( i.e. interbank rate ) is set by the government of Iran ( by the Iranian Banking Association Council ) .
In practice , because the banking system of the Islamic Republic is run on an Islamic interest-free basis , there are no " interest rates " per se but only " provisional profit " lending rates called Mobadala .
Official " provisional " lending rate ( aka " Mobadala " ) 12.0 % ( 2007 ) , 11.5 % ( 2008 ) , 12.0 % ( 2009 ) .
Free market rate is 24-25 percent ( Aug 2009 ) .
Deposit rates As of 2010 , private banks have acquired 11 percent of the whole money market in Iran .
* The range given covers the different interest rates offered by different banks .
In 2010 , for the first time in annual policies , the interest payable on bank deposits is similar for both state-owned and privately owned banks .
For example , overnight deposits ’ interest has been reduced from 12.5 % last year to 9 % this year .
Similarly , 5-year term deposits will now earn 17.5 % ( per annum ) interest , as opposed to 19 % the previous year.As of April 2014 , the maximum interest rate for deposits of 90 days or less is set at 10 percent , the maximum rate for deposits of more than 1 year is set at 22 percent , and for other maturities the cap is set at 14 to 18 percent.In April 2015 , the Central Bank of Iran reduced the maximum interest rate to 20 percent.In June 2016 , bankers agreed to offer a maximum 15 percent interest on one-year deposits , down from the previous 18 % .
The rate for short-term deposits is set at 10 to 14 percent .
Banking assets and liabilities Bank Melli , Saderat and Sepah are Iran 's three largest banks .
The government plans to clear government arrears , recapitalize banks and strengthen supervisory powers ( 2016 ) .
IMF estimates public debt could be as high as 40 % of GDP once government arrears to the private sector are recognized .
Debts to the Central Bank of Iran The total debt of 11 state-run banks to the Central Bank of Iran has exceeded $ 32 billion in 2009 , showing a 10-fold increase over the past four years .
Bank Melli Iran ( aka National Bank of Iran ) , with nearly $ 9 billion , had the biggest debt followed by Bank Sepah , Iran 's oldest , with about $ 4.8 billion .
Bank Maskan , Bank Keshavarzi , Bank of Industry and Mines and the Export Development Bank of Iran were next with the respective debts of $ 4.7 , $ 4.1 , $ 3.5 and $ 1.1 billion .
Private sector banks had much lower debts .
Bank Parsian , the largest private-run bank , owed about $ 421 million to the Central Bank .
In addition , the collective debt of state-sector companies to the Central Bank has reached $ 25 billion ( 2009 ) .
Debts of banks to the central bank stood at 836.1 trillion rials ( $ 27.3 billion at the official exchange rate ) by the end of the fiscal year that ended in March 2016 .
Private banks debts amounted to $ 4.06 billion .
Five specialized bank , all state-run , accounted for $ 18.7 billion ( or 68.5 percent ) of the banking sector debts to the central bank by March 2016 .
Overdue loans According to unofficial figures , overdue loans have reached IR175 ,000 bn ( $ 17.8 bn , $ 13.6 bn , # 11bn ) , an increase of 75 per cent over three years ( November 2008 ) .
Plan to inject about $ 13 billion to recapitalize the banking sector ( 2008 ) .
Ninety individuals have managed to secure collective facilities totaling $ 8 billion from Iranian banks , with previous $ 27 billion unpaid loans ( 2009 ) .
In October 2009 , Iran 's General Inspection Office informed that Iranian banks have some USD 38 billion of delinquent loans , while they are only capitalized at USD 20 billion .
Current average for late debts of Iran 's state banks is over 15 percent while the global standard is 3 to 5 percent .
Non-performing loans peaked at 17 percent of total loans in 2013 , representing almost 10 percent of non-oil gross domestic product , according to the IMF.Regarding corruption and cronyism in the banking sector , Tehran Prosecutor General Abbas Jafari Dowlatabadi said in 2016 : " Banking has been a safe haven in all such cases for corruption to incubate , with high-ranking management turning a blind eye on the corruption underway in inner organizational levels and or actively participating to gain their illicit interests [ .
. ]
11 banks had paid a sum of $ 2.5 bn , with 1287 individuals filing for insolvency ; the deadlock to be solved requires three fundamental approaches ; the first remains with banks to adapt stricter roles and criteria for granting loans ; the bank directors should be in the frontline of the fight for corruption ; no run of-the-mill entrepreneur should receive inordinate amounts without putting in stake enough guarantees ; cronyism should be abolished and unqualified evidence should not be lent credence as individual ’s credentials as receiving loans . "
Summary of the assets and liabilities of the banking system In FY 2004 the balance sheet of the banking system showed that total assets and liabilities were US$ 165 billion , an increase of 226 percent since 1976 .
In that year , bank assets were divided as follows : private debt , 34 percent ; government debt , 16 percent ; and foreign assets ( 90 percent foreign exchange ) , 22 percent .
Liquidity funds ( money and quasi-money ) accounted for more than 39 percent of total liabilities .
The loan-to-deposit ratio was 100.8 % in 2011 .
In 2014 non-performing loan ratio was reported to be around 18 % .
By 2017 , the government is required to pay $ 12.5 billion to domestic banks to settle debts .
A new report shows the assets of Iranian banks increased by a whopping 40 % in 2014 .
In 2014 , the total capital of Iranian banks reached the unprecedented figure of 13.3 quadrillion IRR ( $ 480 billion ) , an increase of 3.8 quadrillion IRR ( $ 138 billion ) over 2013 ( i.e. 17 % increase over 2013 ) .
The deposits in Iranian banks for 2014 reached 5.9 quadrillion IRR ( $ 214 billion ) and the loans paid to the public totaled 5 quadrillion IRR ( $ 183 billion ) .
The deposits indicate a growth of 34 % while the loans were up 22 % compared to 2013 .
( 1 ) Excludes commercial banks ’ branches abroad .
As of March 2010 , Bank Saderat Iran , Bank Mellat , Tejarat Bank , and Refah Kargaran Bank have been classified as private banks.As of September 2014 , Assets : The banks and financial institutions , total claims on the public sector ( government and governmental institutions ) amounted to 929 trillion IRR ( $ 34.8 billion ) , and total claims on the non-public sector amounted to 5412 trillion IRR ( $ 203 billion ) .
The ratio of the claims on the public sector to the claims on the non-public sector was 17.2 % in September 2014 , 15.6 % one year before , and 13.4 % two years before .
This trend suggests that the government is using more bank resources than it was previously , and that banks are getting more dependent on the government ’s solvency.Liabilities : Deposits of the non-public sector amounted to 6245 trillion IRR ( $ 234 billion ) of which 78.4 % is term deposits ; this number was 74.5 % one year before and 73 % two years before .
The trend is towards more term deposits and less sight deposits which could be a result of the higher cost of money , the downward trend in the inflation rate , and the stability in the economy .
The breakdown of term deposits shows that 44 percent of term deposits are short-term and the rest are long-term .
In line with these changes , taking a look at the yield curve for the last 5 years shows that the right side of the curve has moved upward significantly and the left side has become steeper , making long-term deposits more attractive .
Capital ratios The average capital adequacy ratio of Iranian banks is 4 % , whereas according to international financial soundness indicators , the standard of capital adequacy ratios in Basel II and Basel III are above 8 % and 12 % , respectively .
According to the IMF in 2016 : " Where such tests identify shortfalls in capital or risk management practices , [ Iranian ] banks should be required to present and implement time-bound plans to remedy these shortfalls .
Any bank that is not viable after such a process should be resolved . "
Banking reserves The ratios of the banks ' legal reserves in the Central Bank in 2009 were as follows : Current deposit : 20 percentInterest-free-loan deposit : 10 percentShort-term deposit : 17 percentOne-year deposit : 17 percentTwo - and Three-year deposit : 15 percentFour-year deposit : 13 percentFive-year deposit : 11 percentOther deposits : 20 percentAccording to Article 14 of the Monetary and Banking Law of Iran , the CBI is authorized to determine reserve requirement ratio within 10 to 30 percent depending on banks ’ liabilities ’ composition and field of activity .
Sectoral allocation of banking facilities In 2008 , Iranian banks extended 70 trillion rials ( $ 7 billion ) to quick-yield economic enterprises .
According to Article 14 of the Monetary and Banking Law of Iran , the CBI can intervene in and supervise monetary and banking affairs through limiting banks , specifying the mechanisms for use of funds and determining the ceiling of loans and credits in each sector .
OTC market Since 2009 , Iran has been developing an over-the-counter ( OTC ) market for bonds and equities called Farabourse .
Its shareholders include the Tehran Stock Exchange Corporation ( 20 % ) , several banks , insurance companies and other financial institutions ( 60 % ) , and private and institutional shareholders ( 20 % ) .
As of July 2011 , Farabourse has a total market capitalisation of $ 20 billion and a monthly volume of $ 2 billion.In 2010 , 5.5 % of the Mobile Telecommunication Company of Iran shares were offered on the Iranian Over-The-Counter ( OTC ) market , at a value of $ 396 million .
This was the largest IPO-to-date in the Iranian OTC equity market .
In 2011 , Pardis Petrochemical Co. , the largest producer of urea and ammonia in the Middle East , Amir Kabir Petrochemical Co. , Pasargad Bank , Yazd Alloy Steel Co. and Ravan Fanavar Co ( a car auto part manufacturing company ) went all public .
Bond market Participation papers An important development for the Iranian capital markets was the opening of a fixed income market for the first time in 2009 with the issuance of term deposit certificates ( traded OTC ) .
The only type of tradable Islamic bond in Iran is the " Participation Paper " .
These are typically short term bonds ( 1 -- 3 years ) and have the same economic characteristics as fixed-rate conventional corporate bonds .
For participation loans ( known as Musharakat ( in Persian ) or Musharakah ( in Arabic ) ) the interest rate charged by the banks is dependent on the profitability of the project for which financing is required ( as in project finance ) .
In April 2011 , the government 's plan was to limit the maximum rate at 20 % .
Profit and awards accrued to participation papers are tax exempt .
The Central Bank must obtain approval from the Majlis in order to issue participation papers .
As at 2012 , regulations for fixed income instruments oblige that a market maker always buys back the papers from the sellers in the secondary market at par value if there are no other buyers present .
With participation papers , at the end of the project the profit must be calculated and can then be distributed among the shareholders .
During that time , dividends or interest can be paid.Around nine billion euros worth of participation bonds in foreign currency and Iranian rials have been allocated for different projects in the Oil Ministry in 2010 .
Three billion euros will be allocated to the South Pars gas field and the rest will go to oil field development projects.Bank Mellat 's June 2010 offering of bonds worth 250 million euro overseas is considered the third stage of offering a total of one billion euro in bonds designed to help finance development of phases 15-18 of Iran ’s South Pars natural gas .
The bond has a maturity of three years and an interest rate of eight percent.New issues in July 2010 included $ 300 million of papers by the Tehran Municipality and $ 100 million of participation papers by the Ministry of Energy .
The vast majority of these participation papers pay coupon rates of 2-3 % above bank rates.Also in July 2010 , Iran & Shargh Leasing Co. ( the first non-bank entity to list a fixed income product on the OTC market ) listed $ 8 million worth of participation papers.In August 2010 , Iran sold about $ 500 million worth of bonds for the first development phase of the gas deposit .
The three-year bonds , yield 16 percent.In November 2010 , Iran will sell rial bonds worth $ 2.3 billion to finance the second development phase of its South Pars gas field .
The bonds will be sold through Bank Saderat Iran , Bank Melli Iran and Pars Oil and Gas Co. .
Previously , POGC had sold $ 1.5 billion worth of papers for the same purpose .
These papers pay a coupon of 16 % per annum and have a tenure of 4 years.In November 2010 Keshavarzi Bank listed $ 100 million of one-year tradable certificate of deposit ( CD ’s ) with an annual interest rate of 15 % .
Iran ’s national budget for 2012-13 has envisaged issuing $ 12.5 billion in bonds for financing domestic oil projects.For up-to-date amounts and list of issuing agencies , see CBI 's annual review ( s ) here .
Sukuk Sukuk is an Islamic Fixed income instrument , which looks similar to an asset-backed debt instrument .
As of July 2011 and for the first time since the law was passed 3 years ago , Iranian companies such as Mahan Airlines and Saman Bank have respectively issued $ 30 million and $ 100 million worth of this type of bonds .
Iran will also issue $ 15 billion in sukuk ( Islamic Sharia-based ) bonds in 2012 to be invested in the domestic oil industry .
Trading of Islamic bonds using the salam format , a deferred sale contract , was disallowed by AAOIFI in 2007 .
But in Iran 's debt market , salam is a common form of sukuk .
Mortgage Backed Security ( MBS ) is allowed in Iran 's secondary market ( e.g. Farabourse ) .
According to AAOIF , main structures of sukuks are : Sukuk Ijara ( leasing ) : “ The transfer of ownership for an agreed upon consideration ” Sukuk Musharaka ( joint venture ) : “ A form of partnership between the Islamic bank and its clients whereby each party contributes to the capital of the partnership in equal or varying degrees to establish a new project or share in an existing one , and whereby each of the parties becomes an owner of the capital on a permanent or declining basis and shall have his due share of profits ” ( see " Participation papers " section above . )
Sukuk Istisna’a ( manufacturing finance ) : " A contract of sale of specified items to be manufactured or constructed , with an obligation on the part of the manufacturer or builder ( contractor ) to deliver them to the customer upon completion ” Sukuk Al-Murabaha ( cost plus " profit " ) : “ Sale of goods with an agreed upon profit mark up on the cost ” ( used as basis to justify credit card industry ) List of Iranian banks In 2010 , The Banker listed 13 Iranian banks in the " top 1,000 banks in the world " .
In 2005 the Iranian banking system consisted of a central bank , 10 government-owned commercial and specialized banks , and four private commercial banks .
In 2004 there were 13,952 commercial bank branches , 53 of which were foreign branches .
Specialized banks had 2,663 branches .
As of 2016 , banking in Iran employs more than 200,000 staff in more than 23,000 branches of banks and credit institutions nationwide .
Commercial government-owned banks Specialized government-owned banks Non-government-owned banks Investment institutions Presence abroad A number of Iranian banks have established branches abroad , several of which have been subject to program of consolidation .
Thus , in recent years , Bank Saderat has acquired the Iran Overseas Investment Bank ( from Bank Mellat ) , and branches of Bank Melli and the Bank of Industry and Mines in London to form Saderat International .
In addition , the London branches of Bank Tejarat and Bank Mellat merged to form Persia Bank .
As of 2016 , Bank Melli Iran branches in Hamburg and Paris , Bank Sepah Plc in London and Bank Sepah branches in Rome and Frankfurt are also among Iranian state-owned financial entities licensed to operate in Europe .
Venture capital In recent decades Iran has shown an increasing interest in various entrepreneurship fields , in higher educational settings , policy making and business .
Although primary and secondary school textbooks do not address entrepreneurship , several universities including Tehran University and Sharif University , offer courses on entrepreneurship to undergraduate and graduate students.According to the 2012 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor report , the rate of entrepreneurship in Iran among men fluctuated between 14 and 20 % while the same rate for women ( between the ages 18 to 64 ) fluctuated from 4 to 6 % between 2008 and 2012 ( & while their overall economic participation makes up only 13 % of the entire economy ) .
In 2012 , Iran scored 67 among 177 countries according to the Global Entrepreneurship and Development Index .
Some of this activity falls under the informal economy.Iran ’s fifth economic plan ( 2010 -- 15 ) has allotted $ 3 billion to the Initial Investment Technology Fund , which is designed to support new university graduates who want to develop their ideas and carry out innovative projects .
The Innovation and Prosperity Fund was also established in March 2011 to support knowledge base companies & foreign direct investment in Iran .
Avatech is one of Iran 's well-known start-up incubator located at Tehran University .
Sarava and Griffon Capital are Iran 's first venture-capital and private equity funds respectively .
As of 2014 , Canton Hermidas Private Equity and Swicorp are the two foreign based private equity funds that have a focus on Iran .
Foreign companies are beginning to explore ways to start technology companies in Iran or allow their services to become available in the country .
Foreign banks According to CBI , five offices of foreign banks ( as of May 2012 ) operate in Tehran and Kish free trade zone.Article 44 ( fifth clause ) of the Iranian Constitution Law had heretofore placed banking activities exclusively in the hands of government .
In tandem with the Law on Usury Free Banking Operations , these two measures effectively blocked foreign banking operations from conducting business in mainland Iran .
In 2009 the Constitution was to be amended to allow foreign banks to operate normally in mainland Iran.As of 2015 , there is no limitation for the activities of foreign banks in Iranian free economic zones .
They may also open branches and representative offices in mainland or hold 40 % shares of an independent unit .
Foreign branches The minimum capitalization for establishing a foreign bank branch in Iran is euro 5m .
A handful of foreign bank branches and representative offices extant in the country were allowed to undertake administrative and coordination activities but were not permitted to open customer accounts inside the territory of mainland Iran , receive deposits or extend normative facilities.Until now , foreign banks in Iran have acted as the bridge between foreign companies from the same mother country in the host country .
Foreign companies learned of Iran 's economic and investment opportunities through these foreign banks in the country.In 2010 , the Iranian government lifted a cap on the percentage of shares in Iranian banks that can be owned by a foreign individual or company .
The original law , which applied to both Iranians and foreigners , restricted the amount of shares in a bank that a single company could own to 10 percent and an individual to 5 percent .
Iranian ownership of banks is still subject to the limits.According to the new rules , only the Iranian government has the authority to form joint banks with foreign entities .
Foreign entities can now hold over ten percent of the shares in joint banks with Iran but their shares can not exceed more than 49 percent .
Under the same provisions , foreign individuals and entities that have at least 51 percent Iranian ownership shall be considered Iranian companies .
Mainland activities For the first time since the 1979 Islamic Revolution , Iran is set to allow foreign banks to establish branches in the country and engage in normal banking operations.In 2008 , Bank Markazi ( the central bank ) formally officiated over the opening of Iran 's first foreign bank branch in the capital , Tehran .
The Iran-Europe Commercial Bank , which is registered in Hamburg , Germany , but is majority owned by the Bank of Industry and Mines of Iran .
The second foreign bank to be created in Iran was the joint Iranian-Venezuelan bank .
As of 2010 , similar projects exist with countries such as Russia , Belarus and Egypt.In 2009 , four US banks , including Citibank and Goldman Sachs applied for opening a branch in Iran .
The banks made a formal request to the Central Bank of Iran ( CBI ) to establish a branch .
If the Majlis and CBI approve their request , these four banks will set up a temporary branch in an Iranian free trade zone .
And if they can work according to the Iranian banking law ( i.e. usury-free banking ) , they will also be allowed to open branches in Tehran and other cities.In 2010 , Tehran Times reported [ instead ? ]
that the banks filing the requests for working in Iran were from " states in the Persian Gulf and the Middle East regions as well as Asia " .
Free trade zones Minimum capitalization for a bank operating in Iran 's FTZ is $ 100 million ( 2016 ) .
Foreign banks could operate in Iran 's free trade zone areas for many years and there are three such banks on Iran 's Kish Island in the Persian Gulf ( 2012 ) .
Iran ’s Majlis ( parliament ) has ratified the bill for the establishment of domestic-foreign joint banks and insurance companies in free trade zones .
Sanctions The United States is attempting to isolate Iran from the international financial and commercial system in an effort to promote policy change in Iran regarding its nuclear program and purported terror financing.In 2006 , Swiss banks UBS and Credit Suisse as well as ABN AMRO and HSBC - decided to end their operations in Iran .
UBS announced that it had stopped doing business with Iran because of the company 's economic and risk analysis of the situation in the country .
UBS stated that it will no longer deal with individuals , companies or state institutions such as the Central Bank of Iran.Bank Melli , Saderat and Sepah are Iran 's three largest banks .
They have been hit with UN and US sanctions over the past two years , over alleged links with Iran 's nuclear and missile programmes ( 2008 ) .
Malaysia and U.A.E are also cooperating with the United States in implementing international sanctions against Iran .
Insurance industry The Central Insurance of Iran ( Bimeh Markazi Iran ) is in charge of regulating this sector in Iran .
Five insurance firms dominate the sector , four of which are active in commercial insurance .
The leading player is the Iran Insurance Company , followed by the Asia Insurance Company , the Alborz Insurance Company and the Dana Insurance Company .
Export and Investment Insurance deals with foreign trade .
Insurance companies Asia , Dana and Alborz will be listed on the stock exchange in 2009 after review and improvement in their financial accounts , internal regulations and organizational structure nationwide.In 2006 the market share for private insurance companies stood at 54 % and 46 % for governmental insurance companies .
At the end of 2008 , there were 20 insurance firms active in the market , only 4 of which were state-owned ( with a 75 % market share ) .
As of 2014 , twenty-five insurance companies are active in Iran and all , except one , are privately owned .
Parsian Insurance became the largest privately owned company to be listed on the Tehran Stock Exchange in 2010 .
Parisan is the third largest insurance provider in Iran.In 2008 , the total insurance premiums generated in Iran were $ 4.3 billion .
This is less than 0.1 % of the world ’s total , while Iran has approximately 1 % of the world ’s population .
The insurance penetration rate is approximately 1.4 % , significantly below the global average of 7.5 % .
This underdevelopment is also evident in product diversity.Approximately 60 % of all insurance premiums are generated from car insurance .
There are about 14 million vehicles in Iran and 90 percent of them are insured ( 2012 ) .
Of the 10 million motorcycles that operate on Iran 's roads only 2 million are insured .
Also , 95 % of all premiums come from general insurance contracts and only 5 % relate to life products ( against world average of 58 % for life insurance in 2011 ) .
One of the defining characteristics of the economy is entrenched high inflation ( and expectations ) thanks to persistent monetisation of fiscal deficits .
This produces an environment in which no prudent person would enter into a long-term savings contract .
According to Business Monitor International , unless and until economic policies in Iran change radically , the reality of the insurance sector will fall a long way short of its potential.Blood money was $ 67,500 in 2011 , down from $ 90,000 a year before.Since 2012 , Iran is insuring its own fleet of oil tankers because of international sanctions.Payout ratios have shown consistent growth over the years .
Last year , the industry average payout ratio was 86 % .
Iran has 2 re-insurers .
Insurance premiums come to just below 1 % of GDP .
This is partly attributable to low average income per head .
In 2001/02 third-party liability insurance accounted for 46 % of premiums , followed by health insurance ( 13 % ) , fire insurance ( around 10 % ) and life insurance ( 9.9 % ) .
The Central Insurance of Iran is currently in the process of implementing some deregulation within the industry and migrating from a tariff-based regulation regime to a prudential based one ( such as the Solvency regime ) , which is in line with the internationally accepted standards.Insurance industry ’s payout ratio stood at 63.8 % during the fiscal year ended in March 2016 .
Insurers ' generated premiums totaled $ 6.5 billion during the said period .
Iran Insurance Company , the only state-owned firm , accounted for 39.47 % of the premium .
Asia Insurance and Alborz Insurance trail by a big margin behind IIC , holding 10.15 % and 7.56 % of the market ’s share , respectively.Third-part auto liability accounted for 37.6 % of insurance firms ’ total generated premiums during the year ended in March 2016 , with insurers selling about 19.18 million auto policies in the period .
As of 2014 total ( non-life ) market premium was 1.27 % of GDP with only $ 69 per capita spent on insurance.As of 2016 , Norway 's Skuld ( shipping ) , UK 's Steamship Mutual and Standard Club ( shipping ) , Protection and Indemnity ( P&I ) clubs ( shipping ) , France 's Coface ( export guarantee agency ) , Italy 's SACE ( export credit agency ) , Germany 's Hermes ( export credit agency ) , Austria 's OeKB ( export credit agency ) and Switzerland 's SERV ( export credit agency ) are back doing business in Iran .
Many large reinsurance companies are also considering returning to Iran ( including Lloyd 's , Allianz , Zurich Insurance , Hannover Re and RSA ) .

The State of Damascus ( 1920 -- 1924 ; French : État de Damas ; Arabic : دولة دمشق Dawlat Dimashq ) was one of the six states established by the French General Henri Gouraud in the French Mandate of Syria which followed the San Remo conference and the defeat of King Faisal 's short-lived monarchy in Syria.The other states were the State of Aleppo ( 1920 ) , the State of Alawites ( 1920 ) , the State of Jabal Druze ( 1921 ) , and The Sanjak of Alexandretta ( 1921 ) .
The State of Greater Lebanon ( 1920 ) became later the modern country of Lebanon .
Establishment The State of Damascus was declared by the French General Henri Gouraud on 3 September 1920 , with Damascus as its capital .
The first president of the new state was Haqqi Al-Azm .
The state of Damascus included Damascus and its surrounding region , in addition to the cities of Homs , Hama and the Orontes river valley.The new Damascus state lost four Qada 's ( sub-districts ) that had been part of the Vilayet ( district ) of Damascus during Ottoman times to the mainly Christian Mount Lebanon to create the new State of Greater Lebanon .
The territory separated from Damascus corresponds today to the Biqa ' valley plus south Lebanon .
Damascus , and later Syria , continuously protested the separation of these lands and kept demanding them back throughout the mandate period .
The population of these regions , which was mainly Muslim , also protested the separation from Damascus .

The Glaze Brook , or River Glaze , is a minor river in Greater Manchester , England .
From Lately Common ( south of Leigh ) to the River Mersey it forms the county boundary with Cheshire .
It is about 19 miles long and its main tributaries are the Astley , Bedford , Hey , Pennington , Shaw and Westleigh Brooks.The Glaze Brook drains a large area around Leigh and is formed at the outflow of Pennington Flash 53 ° 29 ′ 06 ″ N 2 ° 32 ′ 07 ″ W close to Aspull Common .
Pennington Flash is fed by Hey Brook , a continuation of Nan Holes Brook , which runs eastwards from Ashton-in-Makerfield .
After picking up the waters of Bedford Brook , which runs southward from Leigh and the Black or Moss Brook coming west from Worsley via Chat Moss , the brook turns southward , ultimately draining into the River Mersey section of the Manchester Ship Canal near Cadishead.The Glaze Brook 's catchment drains the flat lowland around Leigh which reaches a maximum altitude of 158 mAOD .
The brook flows through largely agricultural land .
Its tributaries extend into former mining and industrial areas in which mining subsidence has created flashes ( lakes ) at Pennington and Westleigh .
The underlying geology is the sandstone and coal measures of the Lancashire Coalfield .

Richard Shops is a former well-known British high street retailer of women 's fashion .
History Richard Shops was part of the clothes-selling empire United Drapery Stores , a group created in 1927 by Joseph Collier .
Richards was managed by Rudy Weil until his retirement in the mid-1970s .
From the 1960s to the 1990s it was a ubiquitous part of almost every British high street and shopping centre , selling fashion clothing designed to appeal to young women.United Drapery acquired Richard Shops in 1958 , following the acquisitions of the menswear businesses Prices Tailors and Alexandre .
There followed a rapid expansion and promotion of the stores .
In the 1970s a hugely popular television advertisement began to appear with a memorable jingle.In 1983 UDS was sold to Hanson plc , but , in an attempt to recover the cost of the purchase , Hanson immediately split Richard Shops from UDS and sold it on as a separate company .
It was bought by the newly formed retail group Habitat/Mothercare PLC , and became part of Storehouse plc following the merger of Habitat/Mothercare with British Home Stores in 1986 .
With the financial troubles suffered by the Storehouse group in the late 1980s , Richard Shops began to lose direction at a time when the high street was becoming a more competitive place for fashion retailers .
Since 1972 the men 's clothing retailer Burton 's had been expanding its chain of women 's fashion stores under the TopShop brand , and in 1979 it acquired Richard Shops ' longtime rival Dorothy Perkins .
A more direct assault on Richard Shops came from the Burton Group as Burton 's was now known in 1984 when it launched the women 's fashion chain Principles .
Not only did Principles manage to capture something of the mood of the late 1980s in its designs , but it represented the most direct assault to date by Burton on the largely middle-class customer base of Richard Shops.In 1988 Storehouse appointed a new chief executive , Michael Julien [ 1 ] , to replace Terence Conran , and the group was reorganised into three divisions , with Richard Shops sharing ' Speciality Retailing ' with the group 's brands Mothercare , Blazer , Anonymous , and Jacadi.In 1992 Richard Shops was sold to the British retailing giant Sears plc ( not to be confused with the American stores of the same name ) , the then owner of the London department store Selfridges , and the women 's clothing retailers Wallis , Miss Selfridge and Outfit .
In 1999 Sir Philip Green , who had acquired Sears plc , transferred Richard Shops , along with Wallis , to the Arcadia Group which immediately announced the closure of all branches of Richard Shops , or their conversion to other Arcadia brands .
Today Today the company Richard Shops Holdings , and associated limited companies , are still registered with Companies House as ' dormant companies ' with their head offices at Arcadia 's headquarters in London .
However no stores are now trading as Richard Shops .

Plavž ( pronounced [ ˈplaːu̯ʃ ] ) is part of the town of Jesenice in the Upper Carniola region of Slovenia .
Formerly , it was an autonomous settlement .
The name Plavž means ' blast furnace ' in Slovene .
History The settlement developed in the late 16th century when the ironworks then located in the Planina pod Golico area were moved here by the Bucelleni family .
The Bucellenis built new blast furnaces in 1584 , a mansion house , and ( in 1617 ) a church dedicated to St. Barbara.In 1774 the blast furnaces in the area were abandoned and the mansion house pulled down .
The area reverted to agricultural land until the 1950s , when it was developed as the main residential area of Jesenice during the industrial expansion of the Jesenice ironworks after the Second World War , particularly in the 1970s when rows of high-rise blocks of flats were built.The northern section of Plavž is also the location of Jesenice General Hospital , the town 's largest primary school ( Jesenice Tone Čufar Primary School ) and a commercial industrial area adjacent to the railroad tracks .

An end artery ( or terminal artery ) is an artery that is the only supply of oxygenated blood to a portion of tissue.Examples of an end artery include the splenic artery that supplies the spleen and the renal artery that supplies the kidneys .
End arteries are of particular interest to medicine where they supply the heart or brain because if the arteries are occluded , the tissue is completely cut off , leading to a myocardial infarction or an ischaemic stroke .
Other end arteries supply all or parts of the liver , intestines , fingers , toes , ears , nose , retina , penis , and other organs.Because vital tissues such as the brain or heart muscle are vulnerable to ischaemia , arteries often form anastomoses to provide alternative supplies of fresh blood .
End arteries can exist when no anastomosis exists or when an anastomosis exists but is incapable of providing a sufficient supply of blood , thus the two types of end arteries are : Anatomic ( true ) end artery : No anastomoses.Functional end artery : Ineffectual anastomoses.An example of a true terminal arteries is that which supplies the retina .
Functional end arteries supply segments of the brain , liver , kidneys , spleen and intestines ; they may also exist in the heart .

William " Bill " Irwin ( born 23 July 1951 , in Newtownards ) is a Northern Irish former professional footballer , currently working as director of soccer at the University of Portland and head coach of the United States women 's under-23 side .
Personal life Irwin and his wife , Liz , live in Portland with their two sons Bryan , who played for the Portland university team , and Nicholas .
Playing career An Irish amateur international , Irwin began his career at Bangor where he was managed by Charlie Tully .
During his spell at the club , he helped win the clubs first honours when they won the County Antrim Shield and the City Cup in successive seasons .
Prior to his death Tully had recommended Irwin to his former club Celtic but the move never materialised and he eventually joined Welsh side Cardiff City in 1971 .
Brought in to replace Frank Parsons , Irwin was thrown straight into the Cardiff side and performed admirably , including winning the 1971 -- 1972 BBC save of the season award for a spectacular save during a 2 -- 0 defeat in the FA Cup against Leeds United in February 1972 .
He also became the first Cardiff goalkeeper to be sent off during a match after receiving his marching orders against Bangor City during the 1972 -- 73 Welsh Cup final .
Irwin held the position of first choice goalkeeper for four seasons , beating off competition from Parsons and Jim Eadie , until the arrival of Ron Healey in 1974 saw him lose his place .
He eventually left the club in 1978 and went to play for the Washington Diplomats in the NASL.He went on to play at various teams in the NASL before finishing his career with two years playing indoor football in the Major Indoor Soccer League .
Coaching career After his retirement Irwin took up an assistant manager role at the University of Portland alongside former Cardiff teammate Clive Charles .
During his time at the University he has an impressive record of training goalkeepers .
The five starting goalkeepers who have trained under Irwin , Greg Maas , Kasey Keller , Stuart Dobson , Scott Hileman , Curtis Spiteri and most recently Luis Robles , have all gone on to play professional football .
Following the sudden death of Charles in 2003 Irwin was promoted to headcoach after serving as his assistant for sixteen years.Irwin has been involved with goalkeeper coaching throughout the US women 's teams and various youth levels of the men 's team and in 2007 he was appointed as head coach of the US under-23 women 's team , winning the Nordic Cup in his first year .

Hoober Stand is a 30-metre-high ( 98 ft ) tower on a ridge in Wentworth , South Yorkshire in northern England .
It was designed by Henry Flitcroft for the Whig aristocrat Thomas Watson-Wentworth , Earl of Malton ( later the 1st Marquess of Rockingham ) to commemorate the quashing of the 1745 Jacobite rebellion .
It lies close to his country seat Wentworth Woodhouse .
Its site is approximately 157m above sea level and from the top there are long-distance views on a clear day .
It is open to the public 2 -- 5 p.m. on Sundays and bank holiday Mondays from the spring bank holiday weekend until the last Sunday in September .
Hoober Stand is one of several follies in and around Wentworth Woodhouse park .
The others include Needle 's Eye and Keppel 's Column .
History Thomas Watson-Wentworth ( the Earl of Malton and Lord Lieutenant of the West Riding of Yorkshire ) fought for the British Government against the 1745 Jacobite rising .
When the rebellion was crushed , George II elevated the earl to the 1st Marquess of Rockingham ( the title Earl of Malton passed to his only surviving son ) .
Watson-Wentworth commissioned architect Henry Flitcroft to design a commemorative monument.Construction lasted from 1746 to 1748 , and the structure cost # 3,000 .
The inscription above the doorway reads : " 1748This Pyramidal Building was Erectedby his Majestys most Dutyfull SubjectTHOMAS Marquess of Rockingham Etc.In Grateful Respect to the Preserver of our ReligionLaws and LibertysKING GEORGE The SecondWho by the blessing of God having Subdued a most Unnatural RebellionIn Britain Anno 1746Maintains the Ballance of Power and SettlesA just and Honourable peace in Europe1748 " Location Hoober Stand is situated on a high ridge some 157 metres ( 515 ft ) above sea level in a rural area near Rotherham , and is less than a mile from the village of Wentworth .
Vehicular access is along Lea Brook Lane , north of the stand , to a car park next to the monument .
Structure The tower , an equilateral triangle with rounded corners in section and about 30 metres tall , is built in ashlar sandstone .
Its three walls are perpendicular to the ground for 4.5 metres ( 15 ft ) then taper to a hexagonal cupola surrounded by a triangular viewing platform reached by an internal helical stairway of 150 steps .
It is believed that the three walls under the cupola represented England ( including Wales ) , Scotland and Ireland all under one crown .
The exterior is very plain but the interior is more decorative.The stairway is lit by five stairway windows and two cupola windows.The wall with the entrance door faces south .
The solid wooden door has an inscription above the archway .
This wall has the second and fifth stairway windows ( when ascending ) .
On the north west wall the vast majority of the stonework is original .
It has the third stairway window .
The stand 's lightning conductor runs down this wall .
The north east wall has the first and fourth stairway windows.At the top of the tower is the hexagonal cupola with a domed roof .
It is surrounded by a triangular iron-railed viewing platform .
Three of the cupola walls containing the door and windows are parallel to the tower walls .
The door leads out onto the viewing platform .
The platform is in the form of an equilateral triangle , with edges parallel to the south cupola wall and the windowed ( north west and north east ) cupola walls .
The platform corners are adjacent to the cupola 's three windowless ( north , south east and south west ) walls .
Each corner has a decorative stone hexagonal-topped pedestal.The inward taper of the upper part of the three walls causes an optical illusion that the stand is falling over .
The cupola , although situated over the centre of the building , appears to move from side to side as the tower is approached from different angles .

5 Pointz : The Institute of Higher Burnin ' or 5Pointz Aerosol Art Center , Inc. , mainly referred to as simply 5 Pointz or 5Pointz , was an American mural space at 45 -- 46 Davis Street in Long Island City , Queens , New York City .
When the building opened in 1892 , it housed the Neptune Meter factory , which built water meters.Jerry Wolkoff , a developer , bought the property in 1971 or 1972 .
He originally planned to develop the building , but instead leased the space to companies .
Wolkoff started leasing the space as artists ' studios in the 1990s .
The building 's exterior was graffitied over with a myriad of street art , and it became renowned worldwide for the street art .
The factory building gained the name " 5 Pointz " name in 2002 when graffiti artist Jonathan Cohen started using the moniker as a reference to the five boroughs of New York City .
The murals were exhibited mainly on the exterior walls of the building , while the interior was occupied by about 200 artists ' studios.In 2013 , Wolkoff made the controversial decision to demolish 5 Pointz and replace it with a condominium complex .
The announcement resulted in protests and a lawsuit filed by the works ' artists against Wolkoff .
The 5 Pointz building was demolished completely in 2014 .
Construction on the new building complex started in 2015 , with expected completion by 2017 .
Description 5 Pointz consisted of twelve factory buildings that were one , three , or five stories high .
Eight of these structures were interconnected .
The structures had a combined 250,000 to 300,000 square feet ( 23,000 to 28,000 m2 ) of floor space .
The lot on which 5 Pointz was situated is 2.9 acres ( 1.2 ha ) .
5 Pointz was visible from the New York City Subway 's IRT Flushing Line ( 7 and < 7 > trains ) , which passed over the site 's far eastern corner .
According to 5 Pointz ' official website , it was considered to be " the world 's premier graffiti mecca " , where aerosol artists from around the globe painted colorful pieces on the walls of a 200,000-square-foot ( 19,000 m2 ) factory building.It had housed the Crane Street Studios , in which 200 artists paid below-market rents for studio space .
A 450-square-foot ( 42 m2 ) studio was listed as renting for $ 600 per month in 2009 .
5 Pointz was described by an About.com contributor in 2008 as " a living collage of graffiti art covering a converted warehouse full of artist studios " .
The name " 5 Pointz " signifies the five boroughs coming together as one , but , because of its reputation as an epicenter of the graffiti scene , the industrial complex has united aerosol artists from across the world as well .
Writers , including Stay High 149 , Tracy 168 , Cope2 , Part , SPE , Dan Plasma , CORTES and TATS CRU , have come from Canada , Switzerland , the Netherlands , Japan , Brazil , and all over the United States to paint on the building 's walls .
5 Pointz had also been the subject of articles in newspapers such as The Christian Science Monitor , The Boston Globe , The New York Times , and the International Herald Tribune .
Context and usage The building was originally constructed in 1892 for Neptune Meter as a factory for the construction of water meters .
At the time , the company was known as Thomson Meter Company ; it changed its name in 1893 , a year after the factory 's opening .
The property was bought in 1971 by Jerry Wolkoff , who did not have immediate plans for redevelopment .
Originally , the space was occupied by a record company that created 8-track tapes , CD covers , and items for phonographsWolkoff was approached in the 1990s for permission for the factory to be used for legal graffiti work , which he granted .
The site was first established as the Phun Phactory in 1993 by Pat DiLillo under a program called Graffiti Terminators .
As the new curator for the Phun Factory , DiLillo was adamant that the word " graffiti " now refer to the work displayed at the Phun Factory , as " graffiti " had long been associated with crime and gang activity .
In an effort to legitimize the art movement and set a distance from the negative connotation , he imposed strict rules for future projects .
His rules included that none of the artwork submitted or showcased , would depict gang related symbols .
Additionally , if any of the artists ' tags were found in the neighborhood or neighboring communities , their work would be immediately removed .
DiLillo was also credited by some young artists as the motivation for getting their GEDs and discouraging them from breaking the law.In 2002 , Jonathan Cohen , a graffiti artist going under the moniker of Meres One , began curating work .
If unfamiliar with an artist , Cohen would ask for a sample of their work , and if it is a mural , he will ask for a layout as well .
Cohen renamed the building to " 5 Pointz " , making the building a focal point to the art scene of the five boroughs .
He had plans to convert the 5 Pointz building into a graffiti museum.In April 2009 , the New York City Department of Buildings ordered the largest building closed after citing it for numerous building deficiencies including the studio partitions which were built without permits .
The inspections followed an incident on April 10 , 2009 , in which an artist was injured when part of a concrete fire escape collapsed .
Demolition plans After 40 years of ownership , the Wolkoff family decided to develop the 5 Pointz site , stating that allowance of the murals on the building had been for temporary purposes and that redevelopment of the site had been planned ever since it started to be used for graffiti .
On August 21 , 2013 , the New York City Planning Commission unanimously voted to approve plans to build condos on the property , while the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission rejected a landmark status nomination by artists because the art was less than 30 years old at the time .
The development plans include two residential towers with retail space and affordable housing .
There would be a 1,000-unit apartment complex with a 250-spot parking lot , a public park .
Wolkoff wanted to demolish 5 Pointz by the end of 2013 for this purpose .
On October 9 , the New York City Council unanimously approved the $ 400 million development plan .
The proposals for the building also called for 10,000 square feet ( 930 m2 ) to be used exclusively for art panels and walls in the building , including ground level facades to be used for curated graffiti .
It was estimated that in the last decade of the building 's existence , there had been 11,000 murals painted on the interior and exterior.In October 2013 Cohen , speaking to The Guardian , made an appeal to the famous street artist Banksy .
Hoping that Banksy 's influence could help save 5 Pointz , he said " We ’re not asking you to give us money , but your words could help .
Why do n’t you put a comment out ? ”
.
This was in the midst of Banksy 's highly publicized month-long residency in New York City , during which he released a new piece each day somewhere in the city and posted clues to its whereabouts on his website .
There was no response from Banksy until October 31 , the final day of his residency , when the message posted on his website which accompanied his last piece read , " Thanks for your patience .
It 's been fun .
Save 5pointz .
Bye . "
On the night of November 19 , the graffiti on the exterior of the 5 Pointz building was painted white , providing images that showed the building 's previously graffiti-covered walls partially covered in white paint .
A message posted to 5 Pointz 's Twitter account on the morning of November 19 confirmed the reports .
Despite a lawsuit filed by 5 Pointz proprietors , as well as a rally three days prior to gain petition signatures to protect the building from demolition , the sudden whitewashing indicated that it was already gone .
However , on November 20 , a ruling by a federal judge stated that the whitewashing could result in the Wolkoff family having to pay damages to 5 Pointz artists.Asbestos abatement work began on the property in February 2014 , the first step in the building demolition process .
During this period a group of urban explorers entered to document the building 's interior .
As of August 2014 , 5 Pointz was nearly fully demolished .
By November 2014 , most of the building was reduced to rubble , while part of the building 's shell still stood.The apartment complex was later revised to include 1,115 units , including 223 affordable apartments , as well as 20 art studios and 40,000 square feet ( 3,700 m2 ) of commercial space .
Foundations for the two new buildings on the site , one with 41 stories and the other with 48 , were completed in late 2015 .
The towers stood at 5 and 12 stories , respectively , by January 2017 , and the buildings were expected to be complete by the end of 2017 .
Renderings of the new complex 's interior show murals representative of the old building 's street art , as well as an " engraved graffiti logo " made of steel within the complex 's lobby .
Reactions News of the building 's demolition was generally negatively received by artists , and at least two works of protest have been done upon the building .
On February 3 , 2014 , in protest of the building 's demolition , artists sprayed " Art Murder " in big blue and red letters on the side of the building .
On March 10 , 2014 , upset artists , who had lost a proposal to attain landmark status for the building , staged a protest by draping a large yellow " Gentrification In Progress " banner around the building .
According to an article in Complex magazine in November 2014 , some artists felt that they had been disrespected when the murals were painted over , and that they had lost a sense of community with the demolition of the building .
Additionally , the destruction of 5 Pointz resulted in a scarcity of cheap and legal mural spaces , according to one artist interviewed .
In lieu of 5 Pointz , some mural artists are going to Jersey City and the Bronx instead.Another , similar controversy arose when Wolkoff decided to use " 5 Pointz " as the name for the new condominiums being constructed on 5 Pointz 's site .
He had claimed to own the rights to the building 's name because he owned the building ; however , an application to trademark the name was rejected in March 2014 because it was too close to a similar , existing trademark .
Wolkoff has said that the name refers to the building site , not the art ; his comment had insulted some artists at the site , with two artists saying that " it 's ironic that the same corporation which single-handedly destroyed all the artwork known as 5Pointz is trying to capitalize on its name " and that " the disrespect continues " .
In April 2017 , artists whose works had been featured at 5 Pointz filed a federal lawsuit against Jerry Wolkoff , stating that the destruction of the building violated the 1990 Visual Artists Rights Act , and that they did not receive the notice of the building 's demolition 90 days in advance .
This came after federal judge Frederic Block of the District Court for the Eastern District of New York ruled that the artists could have a jury trial , as opposed to a bench trial where only judges would hear the artists ' and Wolkoff 's arguments .
The trial , which began in mid-October 2017 , was seen as an important case since it would decide whether graffiti could be categorized as art that could be federally protected .
In November 2017 , a jury recommended that Block issue a verdict that Wolkoff 's destruction of the graffiti was illegal .
In popular culture In 2011 , 5 Pointz was the fictionalized site of a major fire in the series finale of the TV show Rescue Me.The building has served as a backdrop for movies , including the climax for the 2013 film Now You See Me.The striking , graffiti-covered warehouse has been used in music videos as well .
Such videos are usually by several hip-hop and R&B stars , including Doug E. Fresh , Kurtis Blow , Grandmaster Caz , Mobb Deep , Rahzel , DJ JS-1 , Boot Camp Clik , Joan Jett , and Joss Stone .

Franco Vittadini ( April 9 , 1884 , in Pavia -- November 30 , 1948 , in Pavia ) was an Italian composer and conductor .
As a composer he is mostly known for his operas and sacred music.Born in Pavia , he began his musical studies in 1903 at the Milan Conservatory , but left prematurely because of a disagreement with the director , Giuseppe Gallignani .
For a short period he was maestro di cappella and organist in Varese , thereafter spending the rest of his life in Pavia where he was the director of the Istituto Musicale from 1924 until his death.As a stage composer , Vittadini found his greatest success with the opera Anima allegra ( 1918 - 1919 ) , performed abroad as well as in Italy .
His ballet Vecchia Milano ( 1928 ) was also very successful .
Vittadini considered his opera Caracciolo ( 1938 ) to be his finest work , but his opera Fiammetta e l'avaro ( 1942 - 1951 ) was more successful at winning audiences.Vittadini received attention outside the theater for his religious works .
He wrote numerous masses and motets in a style very similar to that of Lorenzo Perosi .
His oratorio L'agonia del Redentore ( 1933 ) is considered to be one of his finer works , and his religious drama Nazareth ( 1925 ) forms a bridge between his achievements within sacred compositions and dramatic works .

" The One Thing " is a song by Australian rock group INXS , released in July 1982 as the first single ahead of their third studio album , Shabooh Shoobah , which appeared in October that year .
Background In January 1982 INXS toured New Zealand as support act for Cold Chisel .
Band manager Murphy , became convinced their future no longer lay with Deluxe Records .
RCA ( who distributed Deluxe ) had employed music lover Rockin ' Rod Woods , who had been promoting Eric Clapton , Split Enz and some of the worlds biggest acts .
Woods was passionate about the band and brought key music people along to their gigs .
He encouraged RCA to sign them worldwide because Murphy had played him some demos of future songs .
Deluxe had been unable to attract international interest , and the band decided to record a new song at their own expense , with Mark Opitz at Paradise Studios .
The resultant single , " One Thing " , peaked at number 14 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart .
Due to the success of the song Murphy hired Opitz to produce three more songs .
Murphy also approached WEA Australia with copies of the song , leading to INXS signing a recording deal in July 1982 with WEA for releases in Australia , South East Asia , Japan and New Zealand , Atco Records ( a subsidiary of Atlantic Records ) for North America and Polygram for Europe and the UK.Shabooh Shoobah was released in the United States in February 1983 and peaked at number 46 on the Billboard 200 album chart . "
The One Thing " brought INXS their first Top 40 hit in the US , reaching number 30 on the Billboard Hot 100 in May -- June 1983 .
It was a big hit on album-oriented rock radio , reaching number 2 on the Billboard Top Tracks chart , and was also a top 20 hit in Canada.The music video for the song , directed by Soren Jensen , featured the band members having a decadent banquet with a number of beautiful models , including Hutchence 's then girlfriend Michele Bennett , interspersed with clips of the band playing their instruments .
Hutchence knew Jensen , who was an assistant director on the Australian soap opera , The Young Doctors , through his mother , Patricia , who was a make-up artist for the show .
The models , Susan Stenmark and Karen Pini , who appear in the music video were also actresses on The Young Doctors .
The music video was their first video to air on the fledgling MTV and went into high rotation on the channel , which added to the chart success of the single in the US.We made a crazy video at home in Australia for " The One Thing . "
We fed valium to a few cats and had them running around a table while we had a feast with sexy models and Playboy centerfolds , ripping apart a turkey .
Next thing we knew we had a top 40 hit in America and were opening for Adam Ant .

He filled the position from 1997 to 2013 .
He was the Republican Party 's nominee for Mississippi 's 1st congressional district in the 2008 special and general elections .
Life and career Davis was born in Memphis , Tennessee .
He graduated from Mississippi State University at Starkville with a degree in Civil Engineering .
Upon graduation , he began a career in engineering and consulting.From 1991 to 1997 , Davis served in the Mississippi House of Representatives with assignments to the Appropriations and Public Health committees .
He was elected mayor of Southaven in 1997 and won a fourth term in 2009 .
In 2008 , he began a campaign to fill the seat of U.S. Representative Roger Wicker , who had been appointed to the United States Senate following the resignation of Trent Lott .
The initial primary was a three-candidate race which resulted in a primary runoff between Davis and former mayor Glenn McCullough of Tupelo .
Davis won the runoff and thus became the Republican candidate in the special election.On June 4 , 2013 , Davis lost his bid for a fifth term as mayor of Southaven and was succeeded by Darren Musselwhite , effective June 28 , 2013 .
Congressional elections , 2008 In the initial special election on April 22 for Mississippi 's 1st congressional district , Davis paced second to Democrat Travis Childers , but no candidate received a majority of the vote required to win the seat outright .
Childers and Davis then faced each other in a May 13 runoff .
Childers defeated Davis , 53.7 to 46.3 percent.Childers filled the seat until the general election held on November 4 , 2008 , corresponding with the Obama-McCain presidential contest .
As the Republican nominee once more , Davis again faced Childers and again lost , 54 to 44 percent .
Expense abuse investigation Following an investigation by state auditors into questionable reimbursements , which included a purchase at Priape , a Toronto shop specializing in homosexual merchandise , on December 15 , 2011 , Davis publicly acknowledged that he is gay : " At this point in my life and in my career , while I have tried to maintain separation between my personal and public life , it is obvious that this can no longer remain the case .
While I have performed my job as mayor , in my opinion , as a very conservative , progressive individual -- and still continue to be a very conservative individual -- I think that it is important that I discuss the struggles I have had over the last few years when I came to the realization that I am gay .
The only apology I would make to my supporters if they are upset is the fact that I was not honest enough with myself to be honest with them .
But I have lived my life in public service for 20-plus years , and in order for me to remain sane and move on , I have got to start being honest about who I am . "
In December 2012 , Davis was indicted on state charges of embezzlement , false pretense and making fraudulent statements .
He was arrested and released on $ 3,500 bail .
In a 2017 retrial , Davis was found not guilty of all charges .

The Norwegian Year of Cultural Heritage 2009 or ( in Norwegian ) Kulturminneåret 2009 was aimed at highlighting the diversity and importance of Norway 's cultural heritage for all sectors of the community .
Under the theme of Cultural Heritage in Everyday Life , the arrangements were intended to involve both ordinary citizens and professionals at local , regional and national levels .
Two approaches With a view to broadening the appreciation of cultural memory , two complementary approaches were developed .
One focused on the development of cultural heritage in Norway , building on existing cultural trends and processes , in order to provide a better understanding of how key aspects of today 's heritage have evolved over the years .
The second priority was to enhance cultural heritage documentation by providing a basis for both small local projects and large institutional assignments .
Activities The many activities in support of the Year included exhibitions , cultural tours , school projects and , especially at the local level , incentives for the creation of a wide variety of Wikipedia articles on local history and culture.One of the special projects was centred on Bergensbanen , the Oslo to Bergen railway , which celebrated its centenary in 2009 .
Memory institutions were working with railway enthusiasts and the Norwegian Railway Museum to provide opportunities for towns and villages along the line to investigate how the railway affected their communities.In collaboration with kulturnett.no an important aspect of tangible or intangible cultural memory was highlighted for special attention each week .
Coordination The Norwegian Cultural Heritage Association , an umbrella organisation promoting the role of cultural heritage , was the central coordinator for implementing the Year of Cultural Heritage .
The Association ensured close collaboration with the ministries responsible for the environment and for cultural affairs as well as with the Norwegian Association of Local and Regional Authorities , the Directorate for Cultural Heritage , the Archive , Library and Museum Authority and the Museum Association .

Nagoya Expressway Route 2 Higashiyama Route ( 名古屋高速道路2号東山線 , Nagoya Kōsokudōro Nigō Higashiyamasen ) is an urban expressway in Nagoya , Japan .
It is a part of the Nagoya Expressway network and is owned and operated by Nagoya Expressway Public Corporation .
Overview The first section was opened to traffic in 1988 and the entire route was completed in 2003 .
The expressway is 4 lanes for its entire length.The route runs from west to east through the center of the city of Nagoya .
It begins at Shinsuzaki Junction where it meets the Ring Route and Route 5 .
Route 2 then bisects the Ring Route , meets it once again at Marutachō Junction , and continues eastward .
The route eventually terminates at a junction with the Higashi-Meihan Expressway.Originally it was planned that Route 2 would connect to the Higashi-Meihan at Kamiyashiro Junction which connects directly to the Tōmei Expressway .
However , local opposition led to the route being moved a short distance south to Takabari Junction .
This forces users to pay a relatively expensive toll to access the Tōmei by way of the Higashi-Meihan ( 500 yen for 2.7 km ) .
A description of the planning of Route 2 can be found here.In order to combat congestion on the Ring Route , a plan to divert traffic to Route 2 and local roads has been implemented .
Vehicles using Electronic Toll Collection ( ETC ) are permitted use the exit at Fukiage-higashi Interchange and use local roads to reach the entrance of the same interchange without incurring an additional toll , provided exit and re-entry occurs within 15 minutes .
Diagrams explaining how to take advantage of the plan can be found here .

Yiannis Patilis ( Greek : Γιάννης Πατίλης ) ( born 21 February 1947 in Colonus , Athens ) is a Greek poet .
Biography He spent his childhood in Colonus and later in Patisia .
He has been living in Nea Smyrni since 2005 .
He studied law and modern Greek philology at the University of Athens and worked as a professor of philology in secondary education from 1980 to 2010 .
He was the co-founder of the literary journals To Dentro ( 1978 ) , Nisos -- Music and Poetry ( 1983 ) and Critique and Texts ( 1984 ) .
Since 1986 he has published the literary journal Planodion , while in April 2010 he created and has since run a website for short stories called Bonsai Stories.In 1995 he edited , with the collaboration of Elissavet Liaropoulou , the philological edition in two volumes of Angelos Simiriotis ' poems ( 1870 -- 1944 ) .
Simirioti was a poet from Smyrna in Asia Minor.In 1996 , he was a guest at the Hellenic Studies Program of the University of Princeton and in 2000 a guest poet at the 31st International Poetry Festival in Rotterdam , the Netherlands .
His poems have been translated into many languages and have been included in many anthologies and magazines in Greece and abroad .
In 1997 , the literary magazine Emvolimon prepared and circulated a special issue dedicated to his poetry .
Poetry He belongs to the so-called Genia tou 70 ( ‘ Generation of the ‘ 70s ) , which is a literary term referring to Greek authors who began publishing their work during the 1970s , especially towards the end of the Greek military junta of 1967-1974 and in the first years of the Metapolitefsi .
According to the Dutch Hellenist and translator of his poems into Dutch , Hero Hokwerda , " the poets of this generation fiercely oppose the rise of the modern technological , capitalistic consumer society , which they see as a mortal threat to the individual .
Patilis , despite his sarcasm , is often more humorous and ironic in tone than his contemporaries .
His poetry is truly a poetry of the city , of the daily microcosm of urban life , reflecting the changing times .
If he still uses names from ancient Greek history and mythology , it is not in pursuit of nationalistic goals or in search of a Greek national identity ; his poetry remains strictly personal and is about the place of the individual in modern society . "

Valkyrie Profile : Covenant of the Plume ( ヴァルキリープロファイル 咎を背負う者 , Varukirī Purofairu Toga o Seou Mono , lit .
Valkyrie Profile : The Accused One ( s ) ) is the third installment in the Valkyrie Profile series of role-playing video games developed by tri-Ace .
It was published by Square Enix for the Nintendo DS in 2008 in Japan , later released in North America , Europe , and Australia in 2009 .
The story uses Norse mythology and involves a ten-year-old boy named Wylfred who becomes involved in a civil war that is at the same time a war with the gods .
The game debuted at number two in Japanese video game sales , and was generally well received by critics who cited its dark tone but noted its high degree of difficulty .
Gameplay Valkyrie Profile : Covenant of the Plume 's gameplay is presented mainly from an isometric view , similarly to Final Fantasy Tactics .
The player 's two-dimensional character sprites move about on a three-dimensional map akin to those of a tactical role-playing game .
Characters can attack enemies individually or can actively support each other via the Mutual Assist system .
When an enemy is in range of up to four characters , an exclamation mark will appear , indicating that the character is ready to attack .
Up to four characters are mapped to the A , B , X , and Y buttons , which are used to attack .
Each successful attack fills up the Attack Gauge ; when it reaches 100 , characters can perform powerful attacks called Soul Crushes.The position of characters around enemies during combat can be exploited in a feature called the Active Formation system .
Aligning characters in certain formations can increase the rate of item drops or speed at which the Attack Gauge increases .
Active Formations include the Flank Raid with two characters on opposite sides of an enemy , Axis Raid with two characters in front of and behind an enemy , Trinity Fork where characters surround the enemy on three sides , and Grand Cross where characters surround an enemy on all four sides .
Another new factor in battle involves the Destiny Plume .
By invoking the power of the plume , the player can choose to temporarily grant an ally improved statistics and abilities but once the battle ends , the Destiny Plume overwhelms that character 's physical form and they die permanently .
Using the plume affects the outcome of the plot , leading to different branches of the story or even a Game Over upon overusing the plume in a single chapter.Another aspect to combat is the accumulation of Sin .
Sin is gained by inflicting damage against an enemy whose HP has already been depleted .
Most of the battles in the storyline have a predetermined amount of Sin the player must harvest to appease Hel .
If the appropriate amount of Sin is accumulated by the end of battle , the player will be rewarded with items and equipment but if the amount is not reached , the player will face a set of extremely difficult and powerful enemies .
Plot Setting Valkyrie Profile : Covenant of the Plume is based loosely on Norse mythology .
The roots of the tree Yggdrasil contain the three realms of the world : Asgard , home of the Æsir and Vanir , Midgard , the realm of humans , and Niflheim , the realm of the dead where sinners suffer an eternity of torment by the death goddess Queen Hel .
The souls of noble warriors who fall in combat are collected by Valkyries and brought to the Hall of Valhalla as einherjar to aid the Æsir in their struggle against the Vanir .
The game takes place mostly in Midgard in the kingdom of Artolia , located between the neighboring nations of Villnore and Crell Monferaigne.The story is based on the misotheistic idea of " vengeance on the Gods " .
The protagonist , Wylfred , holds a grudge against the Valkyrie Lenneth , who chose his father Thyodor to become an einherjar .
Without a provider , Thyodor 's family is left impoverished , for which Wylfred blames Lenneth .
Wylfred becomes a mercenary , hoping to one day meet the Valkyrie to exact his revenge .
A dispute between the princes Kristoff and Langrey over the throne of Artolia provides Wylfred with the chance to carry out his plan .
Story Ten-year-old Wylfred lives in the village of Tourque with his friends Ancel and Tilte , sister Elsie , mother Margot , and father Thyodor , a soldier .
One day , Thyodor 's friend Duwain arrives with news that Thyodor has fallen in battle , a Valkyrie 's plume on his corpse indicating he was taken as an einherjar , which Duwain gives to Wylfred .
Thyodor 's death leaves his family in poverty , Elsie dies of starvation , and Margot goes mad from grief .
Wylfred becomes bitter and cynical , vowing vengeance on the reaper of his father 's soul.Years later , Wylfred leaves his mother and becomes a mercenary , hoping that he may also become an einherjar and get his revenge on the Valkyrie .
Ancel follows him , hoping to divert him from his quest .
During a battle at Aullewyn Keep , Wylfred is mortally wounded and hears Queen Hel 's voice , asking if he will do anything for revenge .
Wylfred says yes and awakens to find the Valkyrie 's feather in his hand , not fully understanding what he has done .
Wylfred and Ancel are called upon to fight again and , outnumbered and outmatched , Wylfred invokes the Plume upon his friend .
The incantation increases Ancel 's strength and they defeat their opponents but Ancel dies afterward .
Hel then delivers to Wylfred a woman named Ailyth , who is to accompany him and act as a contact between Wylfred and Hel.Guilty over killing his friend , Wylfred abandons the keep and is ambushed by Cheripha , an Artolian assassin and deserter .
The magician Lockswell tracks her down and after being defeated reveals that he is Cheripha 's father .
Father and daughter reconcile and decide to join Wylfred in his quest .
Wylfred returns home to see his mother , though he does not tell Tilte about 's Ancel 's death.A rebellion against Artolia 's government begins in Camille .
Wylfred must choose to side with one of the three factions in the rebellion , each choice leading to the deaths of the characters in the other two : the rebels , led by the peasant Natalia and knight Earnestthe Artolian suppression force , led by Wylfred 's old captain Heugoe and the sociopathic twins Mireille and Mischkathe mercenaries Darius and Gwendal , sent by Villnore to assassinate Natalia and EarnestIn each case , the rebellion fails .
The story then branches depending on how many times Wylfred has used the Destiny Plume : two uses results in the bad path , one use leads to the normal path , and no uses leads to the best path ; future use also affects which path the story takes.The recent death of the king of Artolia had led to a dispute between the Princes Langrey and Kristoff over the succession to the throne .
Lord Cennair , archmagus of Artolia died mysteriously ; the court magicians Rosea and Lieselotte accused each other of murdering him and both were banished .
Meanwhile , Cennair 's adopted son Ushio tried to track down Rosea and Lieselotte to avenge his death .
On the bad path , Wylfred meets Rosea , who kills Lieselotte after Lieselotte attempts to assassinate Prince Langrey to avert a war .
On the normal path , Wylfred meets Lieselotte , who kills Rosea .
On the best path , Rosea and Lieselotte kill each other after being tracked down by Wylfred and Ushio.With the death of his brother Nicolas in the fighting , Lord Valmur of House Haughn is pressured to support either Prince Langrey or Kristoff , giving one of them a major advantage .
On the bad path , Valmur goes insane after his sister Phiona is killed and their parents Auguste and Reinhilde join Wylfred .
On the normal path , Valmur and Phiona join Wylfred after Auguste and Reinhilde are killed .
On the best path , Valmur 's friend Fauxnel has him assassinated after he refuses to take a side in the conflict .
Fauxnel reveals that he was the one who assassinated Lord Cennair so that he could redeem his disgraced House.War finally breaks out between Langrey and Kristoff .
On the bad path , Wylfred sides with Langrey and defeats Kristoff .
On the normal path , Wylfred sides with Kristoff and defeats Langrey .
On the best path , the Margrave Rouienbourg and Wylfred are forced to lead troops against both princes after diplomacy fails .
They capture them both , though Rouienbourg is killed by Langrey , who later commits suicide in prison.The climax of the story comes with the end of the war .
On the bad and normal paths , Wylfred 's actions have attracted the attention of the Valkyrie , who is sent to stop him .
On the bad path , Wylfred defeats the Valkyrie and his soul is condemned to Niflheim to be devoured to suffer for all eternity .
On the normal path , Wylfred defeats the Valkyrie but Thyodor 's soul intervenes and takes his place in Niflheim , leaving Wylfred to contemplate his sins .

Jerome Junction is a ghost town in Yavapai County , Arizona , United States .
Established in 1894 , the community served as a railroad transfer stop between the town of Prescott and the town of Jerome .
It served as a transfer point between the Santa Fe , Prescott and Phoenix Railway ( SFP&P ) and the narrow-gauge United Verde & Pacific Railway for 25 years .
The narrow-gauge line was built precariously on the side of Woodchute Mountain by William A. Clark after he bought the United Verde Copper Company .
When it was replaced by standard-gauge line on the east side of the mountain from Jerome to Clarkdale in 1920 , Jerome Junction became a ghost town , and in 1923 , the activities of the former town were absorbed by Chino Valley.The location changed names at least 3 times : * 1895 June 7 -- " Junction " post office * 1914 December 23 -- Jerome Junction , railway depot and transfer station * 1923 April 11 -- Copper Siding , Chino Valley , railroad stopAll that remains today are some foundations and railroad equipment .

Henry Opitek ( January 6 , 1911-March 1981 ) became the first patient to survive open heart surgery in 1952 .
On July 3 , 1952 , Opitek , a 41-year-old male suffering from shortness of breath , made medical history at Harper University Hospital in Michigan .
The Dodrill-GMR heart machine , considered by some to be the first operational mechanical heart was successfully used while performing heart surgery on Opitek .
Dr. Forest Dewey Dodrill , a surgeon at Wayne State University ’s Harper Hospital in Detroit , used the machine to bypass Opitek ’s left ventricle for 50 minutes while he opened the patient 's left atrium and worked to repair the mitral valve .
In Dodrill ’s post operative report he notes , " To our knowledge , this is the first instance of survival of a patient when a mechanical heart mechanism was used to take over the complete body function of maintaining the blood supply of the body while the heart was open and operated on . "

Dutch dialects are primarily the dialects that are both cognate with the Dutch language and are spoken in the same language area as the Dutch standard language .
Dutch dialects are remarkably diverse and are found in the Netherlands and northern Belgium.The province of Friesland is bilingual .
The West Frisian language , distinct from Dutch , is spoken here along with standard Dutch and the Stadsfries dialect .
A ( West ) Frisian standard language has also been developed .
First dichotomy In the east , there is a Dutch Low Saxon dialect area : in Groningen ( Gronings ) , Drenthe , Overijssel , and major parts of Gelderland , Low Saxon is spoken .
The IJssel river roughly forms the linguistic watershed here .
The group is not Low Franconian and is very close to neighbouring Low German , but it is still regarded as Dutch from the superordination of the Dutch standard language in this area ever the 17th century : it is Dutch synchronically but not diachronically .
Extension across the borders Gronings , spoken in Groningen ( Netherlands ) , as well as the closely related varieties in adjacent East Frisia ( Germany ) , has been influenced by the Frisian language and takes a special position within the Low Saxon Language.South Guelderish ( Zuid-Gelders ) is a dialect spoken in Gelderland ( Netherlands ) and in adjacent parts of North Rhine-Westphalia ( Germany ) .
Brabantian ( Brabants ) is a dialect spoken in Antwerp , Flemish Brabant ( Belgium ) and North Brabant ( Netherlands ) .
Limburgish ( Limburgs ) is spoken in Limburg ( Belgium ) as well as in Limburg ( Netherlands ) and extends across the German border.West Flemish ( Westvlaams ) is spoken in West Flanders ( Belgium ) , the western part of Zeelandic Flanders ( Netherlands ) and historically also in French Flanders ( France ) .
East Flemish ( Oostvlaams ) is spoken in East Flanders ( Belgium ) and the eastern part of Zeelandic Flanders ( Netherlands ) .
Holland and the Randstad In Holland , Hollandic is spoken , though the original forms of this dialect ( which were heavily influenced by a Frisian substratum and , from the 16th century on , by Brabantian dialects ) are now relatively rare .
The urban dialects of the Randstad , which are Hollandic dialects , do not diverge from standard Dutch very much , but there is a clear difference between the city dialects of Rotterdam , The Hague , Amsterdam or Utrecht.In some rural Hollandic areas more authentic Hollandic dialects are still being used , especially north of Amsterdam .
Another group of dialects based on Hollandic is that spoken in the cities and larger towns of Friesland , where it partially displaced West Frisian in the 16th century and is known as Stadsfries ( " Urban Frisian " ) .
Minority languages Limburgish has the status of official regional language ( or streektaal ) in the Netherlands and Germany ( but not in Belgium ) .
It receives protection by chapter 2 of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages .
Limburgish has been influenced by the Rhinelandic dialects like the Cologne dialect Kölsch , and has had a somewhat different development since the late Middle Ages.Dutch Low Saxon has also been elevated by the Netherlands ( and by Germany ) to the legal status of streektaal ( regional language ) according to the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.Gronings is very much alive in the province of Groningen , although it is not so popular in the city of the same name .
Recent use Dutch dialects and regional languages are not spoken as often as they used to be .
Recent research by Geert Driessen shows that the use of dialects and regional languages among both Dutch adults and youth is in heavy decline .
In 1995 , 27 percent of the Dutch adult population spoke a dialect or regional language on a regular basis , while in 2011 this was no more than 11 percent .
In 1995 , 12 percent of the primary school aged children spoke a dialect or regional language , while in 2011 this had declined to 4 percent .
Of the three officially recognized regional languages Limburgish is spoken most ( in 2011 among adults 54 % , among children 31 % ) and Dutch Low Saxon least ( adults 15 % , children 1 % ) ; Frisian occupies a middle position ( adults 44 % , children 22 % ) .
In Belgium , however , dialects are very much alive ; many senior citizens there are unable to speak standard Dutch .
Flanders In Flanders , there are four main dialect groups : West Flemish ( West-Vlaams ) including French Flemish in the far North of France , East Flemish ( Oost-Vlaams ) , Brabantian ( Brabants ) , which includes several main dialect branches , including Antwerpian , andLimburgish ( Limburgs ) .
Some of these dialects , especially West and East Flemish , have incorporated some French loanwords in everyday language .
An example is fourchette in various forms ( originally a French word meaning fork ) , instead of vork .
Brussels is especially heavily influenced by French because roughly 85 % of the inhabitants of Brussels speak French .
The Limburgish in Belgium is closely related to Dutch Limburgish .
An oddity of West Flemings ( and to a lesser extent , East Flemings ) is that , when they speak AN , their pronunciation of the " soft g " sound ( the voiced velar fricative ) is almost identical to that of the " h " sound ( the voiced glottal fricative ) , thus , the words held ( hero ) and geld ( money ) sound nearly the same , except that the latter word has a ' y ' / j / sound embedded into the " soft g " .
When they speak their local dialect , however , their " g " is almost the " h " of the Algemeen Nederlands , and they do not pronounce the " h " .
Some Flemish dialects are so distinct that they might be considered as separate language variants , although the strong significance of language in Belgian politics would prevent the government from classifying them as such .
West Flemish in particular has sometimes been considered a distinct variety .
Dialect borders of these dialects do not correspond to present political boundaries , but reflect older , medieval divisions.The Brabantian dialect group , for instance , also extends to much of the south of the Netherlands , and so does Limburgish .
West Flemish is also spoken in Zeelandic Flanders ( part of the Dutch province of Zeeland ) , and by older people in French Flanders ( a small area that borders Belgium ) .
Sister and daughter languages Many native speakers of Dutch , both in Belgium and the Netherlands , assume that Afrikaans and West Frisian are ' deviant ' dialects of Dutch .
In fact , they are separate and different languages , a daughter language and a sister language , respectively .
Afrikaans evolved mainly from 17th century Dutch dialects , but had influences from various other languages in South Africa .
However , it is still largely mutually intelligible with Dutch .
( West ) Frisian evolved from the same West Germanic branch as Anglo-Saxon and is less akin to Dutch .
Non-European dialects Until the early 20th century , variants of Dutch were still spoken by some descendants of Dutch colonies in the United States .
New Jersey , in particular , had an active Dutch community with a highly divergent dialect spoken as recently as the 1950s .
See Jersey Dutch for more on this dialect.In Pella , Iowa , a derivation of South Guelderish is the Pella Dutch dialect.Despite its name , Pennsylvania Dutch is not a Dutch dialect : it is actually German-based .
Plautdietsch is a Low German variety with influences and elements of Dutch.Russia still has some people in small colonies speaking Dutch-based dialects .

803 Naval Air Squadron was a Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm squadron .
History Interwar 803 NAS was formed on 3 April 1933 by promoting No 409 ( Fleet Fighter ) Flight to the status of a squadron , with nine Ospreys .
In the same month it embarked on HMS Eagle for the Far East , where it remained ( transferring to HMS Hermes in January 1935 ) until disbandment on 1 October 1937.803 Squadron was re-formed on 21 November 1938 at RNAS Worthy Down out of ' B ' Flight of No 800 Squadron .
Equipped with six Ospreys and three Nimrods , then ( from December 1938 ) six Skuas and three Nimrods , the squadron embarked on the HMS Ark Royal in April 1938 as an RAF squadron but was transferred to Admiralty control on 24 May 1939 .
World War II At the outbreak of World War II , the Skuas and Rocs which formed 803 Squadron were embarked on HMS Ark Royal .
Operating out of Scapa Flow , the squadron carried out anti-submarine patrols in the Northwestern Approaches ( losing two Skuas in an attack on U-30 on 14 September 1939 and defending SS Fanad Head ) and regular patrols off Norway ( during which the squadron shot down the first German aircraft to be shot down by a British aircraft in the war , a Dornier 18 , on 26 September 1939 ) .
The squadron 's activities continued off Norway ( though leaving her Rocs behind ) , operating there in April 1940 from HMS Glorious .
803 and 800 Squadrons successfully dive bombed and sank the German cruiser Königsberg at Bergen ( with 800 providing five aircraft and seven crews in contrast to 803 's eleven aircraft and nine crews ) , though an attack by 803 from Ark Royal on the German battleship Scharnhorst in June was less successful , with the loss of all but two aircraft .803 Squadron was re-formed ( with Fairey Fulmar I ) in October 1940 , and after that served in the Eastern Mediterranean off HMS Formidable , fighting at the Battle of Cape Matapan ( shooting down two aircraft and damaging two more ) and providing fighter cover for the Malta convoys and the evacuation of Crete .
After HMS Formidable was damaged at Crete , 803 Squadron moved to Dekheila , where it was re-equipped with RAF Hurricanes .
Next it was based in Palestine for operations against Syria from June 1941 , then in August 1941 was merged into the RN Fighter Squadron ( a combined unit fighting in the Western Desert ) .
Re-equipped again with Fairey Fulmar II in March 1942 , it next operated from Ceylon against the Japanese ( such as against the Easter Sunday Raid ) , rejoining HMS Formidable in the Indian Ocean in April .
803 Squadron then saw operations in East Africa in 1943 , before absorbing 806 Squadron for army co-operation exercises .
The new combined squadron was disbanded at Tanga in August 1943 , and only re-formed in June 1945 ready to join 19th Carrier Air Group in the Far Eastern theatre .
At the re-formation it was based at Arbroath and equipped with 25 Seafire L.IIIs , but just as it was about to ship out to the Far East in August 1945 , the war came to an end .
Post-war 803 Squadron was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy in January 1946 when HMS Warrior was commisissoned , in which she was re-numbered 870 Squadron ( RCN ) in May 1951 ( with the 803 designation returning to the Royal Navy ) .803 NAS became the first FAA squadron to operate a ' nuclear capable ' aircraft in 1958 when it received the Supermarine Scimitar F. 1 .
The squadron deployed aboard the newly rebuilt carrier HMS Victorious and remained attached to her air group for the next two years , after which the squadron transferred to HMS Hermes for another two years then finally to HMS Ark Royal .
From first commissioning until it joined the Ark Royal , the squadron had a normal complement of eight aircraft , but when assigned to the Ark Royal ´ s air group the ships larger size and hangar capacity meant the squadron strength could be doubled to 16 aircraft .
This was achieved by merging 800 NAS into 803 Squadron , as the former was due to re-equip with Blackburn Buccaneer S. 1 aircraft .
803 NAS had the distinction of being both the first and last Scimitar frontline squadron in the Royal Navy , and disbanded on 1 October 1966 after eight years and five months in commission .
The Scimitars went to RNAS Brawdy , Pembrokeshire .
There , they were overhauled before flying to Airworks at Hurn .
Subsequently , many appeared around the UK on display at large establishments .
803 NAS reformed as the Buccaneer S. 2 trials and headquarters squadron on 3 July 1967 , based at RNAS Lossiemouth , and in August 1968 demonstrated the FAA 's ability to reinforce forward deployed carriers when a flight of four Buccaneer S. 2s flew from Britain to HMS Hermes in the Indian Ocean .
With the rundown of the British carrier force , 803 NAS was disbanded on 18 December 1969 and the aircraft were transferred to the RAF .

The Northrop Grumman Brilliant Anti-Tank ( BAT ) is a United States submunition round dispensed from a missile .
It is capable of independently identifying and attacking armored vehicles .
The BAT uses acoustic sensors to identify its intended targets , and an infrared homing ( IR ) terminal seeker to image and aim at the attack target.It was intended to carry 13 BATs on the MGM-164 ATACMS Block II missile fired from the M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System and related systems .
Block I ATACMS missiles have a range of 128 km or more , but Block II was cancelled in 2003 .
History The BAT submunition was an outgrowth of the Assault Breaker Project .
This broad ranging Cold War project ’s objective was to develop advanced weapon systems to destroy a Soviet armored assault across the inter-German border ( between West German and East German ) .
An early successful weapon system was the Hellfire Missile .
The Hellfire was classified as a smart weapon because of the intelligence in the guidance system.An obvious shortcoming of the Hellfire is that the launch platform must acquire the target and in so doing expose itself .
The concept of the BAT was to be able to project the submunitions deep behind enemy lines and autonomously attack high-value armored formations before they could engage NATO forces .
As originally envisioned , there would have been multiple platforms able to dispense the BAT .
These include aircraft dispensers , artillery dispensers and missile dispensers .
The intelligence required of the BAT was much greater than the Hellfire and other weapon systems classified as smart , and the term " Brilliant " was applied.Northrop was the prime contractor for the BAT .
Much of the " brilliance " has to do with the submunitions ' ability to distinguish high-value targets from low-value targets and strike them in known weak points.The Assault Breaker Project included systems to detect Soviet armor formations deep behind the front lines .
This included the Grumman E-8 Joint STARS ( JSTARS ) .
Use scenario Designed to break up large mechanized formations , the M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System ( MLRS ) fires missiles carrying BAT submunitions to the targeted formation .
The BAT submunitions are dispensed over the target area .
The “ wings ” , tail fins and retarders ( parachutes ) are deployed on each BAT .
The four “ wings ” have directional microphones on each tip.The BAT identifies high-value targets acoustically , using programs evolved from submarine warfare systems .
The highest-value targets are selected and the Raytheon Optical system in the nose images the designated target .
Each target 's weakest point is selected .
The retarder is dropped , the rocket motor fires , and is optically guided .
A tandem-charge warhead is used to defeat any reactive armour present .
In addition , thrust from the rocket motor provides kinetic energy to help destroy the target .
Beyond development With the Cold War over , the threat that instigated the Assault Breaker Project disappeared .
Many of the weapon systems in development were abandoned as funds dried up .
The only dispenser for the BAT is a missile launched from the MLRS , the Air Force dropped plans for aircraft dispensers .
Northrop was fond of the idea of using the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber to drop BATs anywhere in the world , but the unmodified BAT has become a system that does n't address a current threat .
The current stockpiles are zero-funded , with neither further acquisition funds nor maintenance funds for existing stocks .
Viper Strike Northrop has used adapted BAT missiles as the basis for the GBU-44 / B Viper Strike weapons system for use on UAVs .

Dysexecutive syndrome ( DES ) consists of a group of symptoms , usually resulting from brain damage , that fall into cognitive , behavioural and emotional categories and tend to occur together .
The term was introduced by Alan Baddeley to describe a common pattern of dysfunction in executive functions , such as planning , abstract thinking , flexibility and behavioural control .
It is thought to be Baddeley 's hypothesized working memory system and the central executive that are the hypothetical systems impaired in DES .
The syndrome was once known as frontal lobe syndrome , however dysexecutive syndrome is preferred because it emphasizes the functional pattern of deficits ( the symptoms ) over the location of the syndrome in the frontal lobe , which is often not the only area affected .
Classification code in ICD-10 - F07 Symptoms Symptoms of DES fall into three broad categories : cognitive , emotional and behavioural .
Many of the symptoms can be seen as a direct result of impairment to the central executive component of working memory , which is responsible for attentional control and inhibition .
Although many of the symptoms regularly co-occur , it is common to encounter patients who have several , but not all symptoms .
The accumulated effects of the symptoms have a large impact on daily life .
Cognitive symptoms Cognitive symptoms refer to a person 's ability to process thoughts .
Cognition primarily refers to memory , the ability to learn new information , speech , and reading comprehension .
Deficits within this area cause many problems with every day life decisions.One of the main difficulties for an individual with DES is planning and reasoning .
Impaired planning and reasoning affect the individual 's ability to realistically assess and manage the problems of every day living .
New problems and situations may be especially poorly handled because of the inability to transfer previous knowledge to the new event .
An individual that has DES may have a short attention span due to impairment in attentional control .
This may alter the individual 's ability to focus , and as such have difficulty with reading and following a storyline or conversation .
For instance , they can easily lose track of conversations which can make it difficult to hold a meaningful conversation and may result in avoiding social interactions.Individuals with DES will have very poor working memory and short term memory due to executive dysfunction .
The dysfunction can range from mild and subtle to severe and obvious .
There is a tremendous variability in the manifestations of executive dysfunction with strong influences often apparent from the afflicted person 's personality , life experiences and intellect .
Individuals with DES may suffer from confabulation , which is the spontaneous reporting of events that never happened .
This can affect their autobiographical memory .
It is thought that patients may not be able to assess the accuracy of memory retrieval and therefore elaborate on implausible memories.Individuals with dementia , delirium or other severe psychiatric illnesses combined with DES often have disturbed sleep patterns .
Some will not recognize that it is night-time and may become upset when someone tries to correct them .
Emotional symptoms The emotional symptoms that individuals with DES experience may be quite extreme and can cause extensive problems .
They may have difficulty inhibiting many types of emotions such as anger , excitement , sadness , or frustration .
Due to multiple impairments of cognitive functioning , there can be much more frustration when expressing certain feelings and understanding how to interpret every day situations .
Individuals with DES may have higher levels of aggression or anger because they lack abilities that are related to behavioural control .
They can also have difficulty understanding others ' points of view , which can lead to anger and frustration .
Behavioural symptoms Behavioural symptoms are evident through an individual 's actions .
People with DES often lose their social skills because their judgments and insights into what others may be thinking are impaired .
They may have trouble knowing how to behave in group situations and may not know how to follow social norms .
The central executive helps control impulses ; therefore when impaired , patients have poor impulse control .
This can lead to higher levels of aggression and anger .
DES can also cause patients to appear self-centered and stubbornUtilization behaviour is when a patient automatically uses an object in the appropriate manner , but at an inappropriate time .
For example , if a pen and paper are placed in front of an individual with DES they will start to write or if there is a deck of cards they will deal them out .
Patients showing this symptom will begin the behaviour in the middle of conversations or during auditory tests .
Utilization behaviour is thought to occur because an action is initiated when an object is seen , but patients with DES lack the central executive control to inhibit acting it out at inappropriate times.Perseveration is also often seen in patients with DES .
Perseveration is the repetition of thoughts , behaviours , or actions after they have already been completed .
For instance , continually blowing out a match , after it is no longer lit is an example of perseveration behaviour .
There are three types of perseveration : continuous perseveration , stuck-in-set perseveration , and recurrent perseveration .
Stuck-in-set perseveration is most often seen in dysexecutive syndrome .
This type of perseveration refers to when a patient can not get out of a specific frame of mind , such as when asked to name animals they can only name one .
If you ask them to then name colours , they may still give you animals .
Perseveration may explain why some patients appear to have obsessive-compulsive disorder .
Causes The most frequent cause of the syndrome is brain damage to the frontal lobe .
Brain damage leading to the dysexecutive pattern of symptoms can result from physical trauma such as a blow to the head or a stroke or other internal trauma.It is important to note that frontal lobe damage is not the only cause of the syndrome .
It has been shown that damage , such as lesions , in other areas of the brain may indirectly affect executive functions and lead to similar symptoms .
There is not one specific pattern of damage that leads to DES , as multiple affected brain structures and locations have led to the symptoms .
This is one reason why the term frontal lobe syndrome is not preferred .
Comorbid disorders DES often occurs with other disorders , which is known as comorbidity .
Many studies have examined the presence of DES in patients with schizophrenia .
Results of schizophrenic patients on the Behavioural Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome ( BADS ) test ( discussed below ) are comparable to brain injured patients .
Further , results of BADS have been shown to correlate with phases of schizophrenia .
Patients in the chronic phase of the disorder have significantly lower scores than those who are acute .
This is logical due to the similarities in executive disruptions that make everyday life difficult for those with schizophrenia and symptoms that form DES.Patients with Alzheimer 's disease have been shown to exhibit impairment in executive functioning as well .
The effects of DES symptoms on the executive functions and working memory , such as attentiveness , planning and remembering recently learned things , are some of the earliest indicators of Alzheimer 's .
Studies have also indicated that chronic alcoholism ( see Korsakoff 's syndrome ) can lead to a mild form of DES according to results of BADS .
Assessment Assessment of patients with DES can be difficult because traditional tests generally focus on one specific problem for a short period of time .
People with DES can do fairly well on these tests because their problems are related to integrating individual skills into everyday tasks .
The lack of everyday application of traditional tests is known as low ecological validity .
Behavioural The Behavioural Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome ( BADS ) was designed to address the problems of traditional tests and evaluate the everyday problems arising from DES .
BADS is designed around six subtests and ends with the Dysexecutive Questionnaire ( DEX ) .
These tests assess executive functioning in more complex , real-life situations , which improves their ability to predict day-to-day difficulties of DES.The six tests are as follows : Rule Shift Cards - Assesses the subject 's ability to ignore a prior rule after being given a new rule to follow.Action Program - This test requires the use of problem solving to accomplish a new , practical task.Key Search - This test reflects the real-life situation of needing to find something that has been lost .
It assesses the patient 's ability to plan how to accomplish the task and monitor their own progress.Temporal Judgment - Patients are asked to make estimated guesses to a series of questions such as , " how fast do racehorses gallop ? "
.
It tests the ability to make sensible guesses.Zoo Map - Tests the ability to plan while following a set of rules.Modified Six Elements - This test assesses the subject 's ability to plan , organize and monitor behaviour.The Dysexecutive Questionnaire ( DEX ) is a 20-item questionnaire designed to sample emotional , motivational , behavioural and cognitive changes in a subject with DES .
One version is designed for the subject to complete and another version is designed for someone who is close to the individual , such as a relative or caregiver .
Instructions are given to the participant to read 20 statements describing common problems of everyday life and to rate them according to their personal experience .
Each item is scored on a 5-point scale according to its frequency from never ( 0 point ) to very often ( 4 points ) .
Therapy There is no cure for individuals with DES , but there are therapies to help them cope with their symptoms .
DES can affect a number of functions in the brain and vary from person to person .
Because of this variance , it is suggested that the most successful therapy would include multiple methods .
Researchers suggest that a number of factors in the executive functioning need to be improved , including self-awareness , goal setting , planning , self-initiation , self-monitoring , self-inhibition , flexibility , and strategic behaviour.One method for individuals to improve in these areas is to help them plan and carry out actions and intentions through a series of goals and sub-goals .
To accomplish this , therapists teach patients a three-step model called the General Planning Approach .
The first step is Information and Awareness , in which the patients are taught about their own problems and shown how this affects their lives .
The patients are then taught to monitor their executive functions and begin to evaluate them .
The second stage , Goal Setting and Planning , consists of patients making specific goals , as well as devising a plan to accomplish them .
For example , patients may decide they will have lunch with a friend ( their goal ) .
They are taught to write down which friend it may be , where they are going for lunch , what time they are going , how they will get there , etc. ( sub-goals ) .
They are also taught to make sure the steps go in the correct order .
The final stage , named Initiation , Execution , and Regulation , requires patients to implement their goals in their everyday lives .
Initiation can be taught through normal routines .
The first step can cue the patient to go to the next step in their plan .
Execution and regulation are put into action with reminders of how to proceed if something goes wrong in the behavioural script .
This treatment method has resulted in improved daily executive functioning , however no improvements were seen on formal executive functioning tests.Since planning is needed in many activities , different techniques have been used to improve this deficit in patients with DES .
Autobiographical memories can be used to help direct future behaviour .
You can draw on past experiences to know what to do in the future .
For example , when you want to take a bus , you know from past experience that you have to walk to the bus stop , have the exact amount of change , put the change in the slot , and then you can go find a seat .
Patients with DES seem to not be able to use this autobiographical memory as well as a normal person .
Training for DES patients asks them to think of a specific time when they did an activity previously .
They are then instructed to think about how they accomplished this activity .
An example includes " how would you plan a holiday " .
Patients are taught to think of specific times they went on a holiday and then to think how they may have planned these holidays .
By drawing on past experiences patients were better able to make good decisions and plans.Cognitive Analytic Therapy ( CAT ) has also been used to help those with DES .
Because individuals with this syndrome have trouble integrating information into their actions it is often suggested that they have programmed reminders delivered to a cell phone or pager .
This helps them remember how they should behave and discontinue inappropriate actions .
Another method of reminding is to have patients write a letter to themselves .
They can then read the letter whenever they need to .
To help patients remember how to behave , they may also create a diagram .
The diagram helps organize their thoughts and shows the patient how they can change their behaviour in everyday situations.The use of auditory stimuli has been examined in the treatment of DES .
The presentation of auditory stimuli causes an interruption in current activity , which appears to aid in preventing " goal neglect " by increasing the patients ' ability to monitor time and focus on goals .
Given such stimuli , subjects no longer performed below their age group average IQ .
Controversy Some researchers have suggested that DES is mislabelled as a syndrome because it is possible for the symptoms to exist on their own .
Also , there is not a distinct pattern of damage that leads to the syndrome .
Not all patients with frontal lobe damage have DES and some patients with no damage at all to the frontal lobe exhibit the necessary pattern of symptoms .
This has led research to investigate the possibility that executive functioning is broken down into multiple processes that are spread throughout the frontal lobe .
Further disagreement comes from the syndrome being based on Baddeley and Hitch 's model of working memory and the central executive , which is a hypothetical construct.The vagueness of some aspects of the syndrome has led researchers to test for it in a non-clinical sample .
The results show that some dysexecutive behaviours are part of everyday life , and the symptoms exist to varying degrees in everyone .
For example , absent-mindedness and lapses in attention are common everyday occurrences for most people .
However , for the majority of the population such inattentiveness is manageable , whereas patients with DES experience it to such a degree that daily tasks become difficult .

Validity has two distinct fields of application in psychology .
The first is test validity ( or Construct validity ) , the degree to which a test measures what it was designed to measure .
The second is experimental validity ( or External validity ) , the degree to which a study supports the intended conclusion drawn from the results .

Tinerkouk is a town in central Algeria .
Gish Abay is a town in west-central Ethiopia .
Located in the Mirab ( West ) Gojjam Zone of the Amhara Region , it is the administrative center of Sekela woreda .
The town is named after the nearby Mount Gish and the Abay River ( Blue Nile ) whose source is in the foothills of the mountain .
It is the administrative center of Sekela woreda.Based on figures from the Central Statistical Agency in 2005 , Gish Abay has an estimated total population of 3,385 of whom 1,615 are men and 1,770 are women .
The 1994 census reported this town had a total population of 1,959 of whom 850 were men and 1,109 were women .
Source of the Blue Nile Gish Abay is best known as the source of the Abay , or Blue Nile , also known as Felege Ghion in Ge'ez , the liturgical language of Ethiopia .
Felege Ghion consists of three small springs found within a diameter of about 20 meters .
These waters are believed to have a healing power and considered holy by the Ethiopian Church .
The first European recorded as having visited the source of Blue Nile at Gish Abay is Pedro Páez , a Spanish missionary , who arrived at these springs 21 April 1618 .
In the 18th century , the culture and religion of the local people of Gish Abay was chronicled in detail by the 18th century explorer , James Bruce .
The British Consul Robert Cheesman was one of the later discoverers who published a geographical description of the area .
A more recent expedition is made by a group of American navigators who navigate the river from its source at Gish to the Mediterranean Sea , led by geologist Pasquale Scaturro , whose adventure was related in the film Mystery of the Nile.About 100 meters north of the source of Abay is the church of Gish Abay Felege Ghion Abune Zerabruk Monastery , which has been one of the most respected centers for church education over the past centuries .
Although local inhabitants believe the monastery was founded in the 17th century by a local saint called Abune Zerabruk , whose memory is honored with a celebration at the church each year on Tir 13 ( January 20 ) , Cheesman speculated that the name of the saint is a corruption of the explorer James Bruce .
There is also another church in the town , dedicated to Saint Mary , with considerable spiritual significance .
Together with other sites in Sekela woreda , like Fasildes Castle and Lake Gudera , Gish Abay is now identified as a notable tourist destination in Gojjam .
History The town is originally founded in a place called Yideb , a mountainous area where Italian occupation forces fortified during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War .
During the war , the Italian fort was under constant attack from the local Arbegnoch groups , most notably Dejazmach Zelleke Desta , and the Italians left the fort before the arrival of Haile Selassie and British forces .
Then , the area was used as a base for the liberation forces , which attracted the local people to settle at Yideb .
The settlement led to the foundation of Gish Abay which soon became an important market center for cereals and cattle .
Its development continued until the lack of suitable space on the mountainous area of Yideb limited further expansion , and led in 1987 to the town being re-established at a location much closer to Mount Gish and the source of Abay.Modern education was introduced in 1952 with the opening of Dejazmach Zelleke Desta Elementary School .
Now there are other two schools serving the town : the Gish Abay Elementary and Junior High School , and the Abay Minch Secondary and Preparatory High School .
The town is connected by a 39 km gravel road to Tilili , which is located on the main Addis Ababa-Debre Marqos-Bahir Dar road .
Another road , which will connect Gish Abay to Adet is also under construction , which will make the distance with Bahir Dar less than 100 km .

David Wilkie Wynfield ( 1837 -- 1887 ) was a British painter and photographer.Wynfield was distantly related to the Scottish artist David Wilkie , after whom he was named .
Born in India , he was originally intended by his family for the priesthood , but instead chose art as a profession .
He studied at Leigh 's art school in the 1850s and his first painting was accepted for the Royal Academy summer exhibition in 1859 .
Wynfield associated with a group of other artists who became known as the St. John 's Wood Clique .
Their work typically took the form of anecdotal historical narratives .
Wynfield himself painted many works set in Medieval or Renaissance Europe , concentrating on romantic problems of couples.In the 1860s Wynfield became interested in photography .
He developed a technique of shallow-focus portrait photography which he passed on to Julia Margaret Cameron , who later acknowledged him as the main influence on her own work , writing that " to my feeling about his beautiful photography I owed all my attempts and indeed consequently all my success " .
Many of Wynfield 's photographs portrayed members of the St. John 's Wood Clique and their friends in fancy dress .
The combination of soft focus , close-up , large-format print and historical costumes produced a photographic style that was completely original at the time .
Wynfield was attempting to imitate the painterly effects of old master artists such as Titian , using the new medium .
A selection of the photographs was published in 1864 as a book entitled The Studio : A Collection of Photographic Portraits of Living Artists , Taken in the Style of Old Masters , by an Amateur.As with many of the subjects of his photographs Wynfield served in The Artists ' Rifles .
He reached the rank of Captain and was commanding ' H ' Company in 1880 .
In his autobiography his friend Henry Stacy Marks said that Wynfield died of consumption .

Happy Valley Station was a proposed railway station on the South Island Line ( East ) but will no longer be built .
It would have served the Happy Valley area and the Happy Valley Racecourse .
History The station appeared as Happy Valley Station in previous proposals , and was listed in alignment C in the 2005 proposal , which , if chosen , would have been built together with an interchange with the Island Line at Wan Chai .
However , the route via Wan Chai was dismissed in favour of a direct route from Ocean Park to Admiralty , though an option to en route Happy Valley was offered .
The construction of the station was the subject of negotiations between MTR Corporation and Hong Kong Jockey Club , which suggested renaming the station as Racecourse Station , already used by another existing station on East Rail Line.In January 2009 , the government decided not to construct the station after considering economic efficiency , construction time , nuisance to residents and interruption to traffic .

An experimental drug is a medicinal product ( a drug or vaccine ) that has not yet received approval from governmental regulatory authorities for routine use in human or veterinary medicine .
A medicinal product may be approved for use in one disease or condition but still be considered experimental for other diseases or conditions.In the United States , the body responsible for approval is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) , which must grant the substance Investigational New Drug ( IND ) status before it can be tested in human clinical trials .
IND status requires the drug 's sponsor to submit an IND application that includes data from laboratory and animal testing for safety and efficacy.In Canada a Clinical Trial Application ( CTA ) must be filed before starting a clinical trial .
Health Canada will review the application and will notify the sponsor within 30 days if it is found to be deficient.In Europe , the application process to perform a clinical trial takes place on a country-by-country basis .
A sponsor must apply for approval in each country in which it intends to have study sites .
A sponsor also must register their proposed clinical trial in EudraCT , a database of all in European clinical trials that is operated by the European Medicines Agency .

SpVgg Au/Iller is a German football club from the district of Au in the northwest quarter of Illertissen , Bavaria .
The team was founded 27 October 1928 as Sportvereinigung Au when Au was still a separate village on the banks of the river Iller .
History Long an unremarked local side , in 1995 Au won its way out of sixth tier play into the Verbandsliga Württemberg ( V ) where they finished as vice-champions in 1997 before winning the division title in 1999 .
That advanced them to the Oberliga Baden-Württemberg ( IV ) for a five year turn running from 1999 to 2004 .
They also have a 1980 DFB-Pokal ( German Cup ) appearance and a losing appearance in the 1997 Württemberg-Pokal ( Württemberg Cup ) final to their credit.Despite being a Bavarian club , SpVgg plays in the competition of neighbouring Württemberg because the town is closer to others there than in its home state .
Their promotion to the Oberliga Baden-Württemberg in 1999 made them the first Bavarian club to ever play in Baden-Württemberg 's top league.Due to the expansion of the number of clubs in the leagues above , a second-place finish in the Verbandsliga in 2007 -- 08 qualified the club to directly return to the Oberliga for the next season , alongside local rival FV Illertissen .
Au was relegated from the league again in 2008 -- 09 and experienced a desterous 2009 -- 10 campaign in the Verbandsliga , finishing last with only one point to their name , suffering point detuctions and conceding 112 goals in 30 games .
After no improvement at the level below in 2010 -- 11 , the club withdrew its team altogether from the league , thereby suffering another relegation and a restart in the Kreisliga A 3 .
In addition to fielding a football team the sports club has departments for basketball , gymnastics , table tennis and tennis .
Honours The club 's honours : League Verbandsliga Württemberg ( V ) Champions : 1999Landesliga Württemberg 2 ( V-VI ) Champions : 1989 , 1993 , 1995 Recent seasons The recent season-by-season performance of the club : With the introduction of the Regionalligas in 1994 and the 3 .

The Monster of Florence : A True Story is a 2008 true crime book by American thriller writer Douglas Preston and Italian journalist Mario Spezi .
It relates to a series of murders that occurred between 1968 and 1985 and involved couples who were killed while having sex in their cars in deserted lanes around the city of Florence in the Italian region of Tuscany .
Background Preston , an author of fiction and non-fiction books , moved to Florence with his family and became interested in the Monster of Florence case because the murders had taken place in the surrounding countryside .
Mario Spezi , co-author of the book , is a journalist who specialized in the Monster of Florence case for many years .
Preston and Spezi became friends and then collaborated on articles and books about the case .
Both became figures in the case when the Italian prosecutors came to suspect them and accuse them of crimes including obstruction of justice and potentially being accomplices to murder .
Preston published an article about the case in American magazine The Atlantic in 2006 .
Summary The book recounts the authors ' personal experiences while investigating the case and their problems of being accused by the Italian criminal justice system .
Preston and Spezi are outspoken critics of the tactics and theories pursued by the Italian police and prosecutors in the Monster of Florence case .
Film version In late 2008 , film studio United Artists announced its purchase of the film rights to The Monster of Florence : a True Story .
In 2010 the project was acquired by Fox 2000 and is in development , with George Clooney attached as producer as well as to play the role of Preston .

" The Western World " is the sixth track from Pennywise 's ninth studio album Reason to Believe .
It was the album 's first single , which also reached number 22 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart , marking the highest initial charting single in Pennywise 's career .
It also had success in the Peruvian 's rock chart , debuting at number one ; it stayed in that position for four weeks .
Music video The video starts with identical supermodels playing the song as other models walk along the catwalk .
Businessmen are waving money in the air as the models walk .
It is revealed that the models are not actual humans , but robots ( gynoids/cyborgs/synthetic humans ; it is not revealed which ) made by scientists behind a curtain .
It then shows SWAT team members holding back " normal " people .
The video is interspersed with images of scientists working on the models , and becoming increasingly involved in the song , as more of them start to pump the air with their fists , and chant the song .
Back in the lab behind the scenes , one of the models being created suddenly sits up from the operating table , as the crowd outside breaches the SWAT barricade , and presumably storms the stage , tearing off her connectors , and escapes while the scientists are chanting the song .
She runs along an alleyway , and opens up a door in panic , revealing the band tied and gagged .
The video then cuts to the catwalk , transformed into a stage for the band ( with the audience consisting of both the businessmen , still waving money , and the crowd from outside ) , with the escaped model handing the singer his microphone , then disappearing backstage , as the band performs the rest of the song .
Flashes follow where the lab is show being vandalized by unknown assailants , possibly the people held back by the SWAT teams previously .
The video ends showing the microphone lying on the stage , thrown down by the singer .

Fenton Airfield was a World War II military airfield located at Tipperary Station , Hayes Creek , Northern Territory , Australia and named after flight lieutenant Clyde Fenton.Abandoned since 1945 , the site is one of three surviving World War II-era heavy bomber airfields in the Katherine -- Darwin region .
The airfield is open to the public , and the main runway , taxiways and hardstands are accessible .
Remnants of the control tower remain and aircraft wreckage can be found in the area .
History The airfield was built by C Company and HQ Detachment of the 808th Engineer Aviation Battalion between 27 April 1942 and 16 July 1942 .
The single runway was 6,000 ft × 100 ft ( 1,829 m × 30 m ) .
Further development of the airfield was undertaken by No. 1 Airfield Construction Squadron RAAF , No 14 Airfield Construction Squadron RAAF and New South Wales Department of Main Roads under the Allied Works Council .
The runway was enlarged to approximately 7,218 ft × 164 ft ( 2,200 m × 50 m ) , accommodating close to sixty aircraft dispersal bays , some with earthen revetments.Fenton Airfield was mainly used by Liberator bombers mounting long range raids against Japanese forces in the Netherlands East Indies , the northwestern area of operations , and the South West Pacific Area.During its operational use , Fenton Airfield served as headquarters for Royal Australian Air Force squadrons and United States Army and Air Force units .
Reconnaissance flights beginning at Fenton Airfield were flown over Timor Island , New Guinea and Celebres Islands , and attacks and armed reconnaissance missions were carried out against Japanese airfields , ground installations and shipping .
On 29 February 1944 the USAAF 380th Bombardment Group flew a 16-hour mission from Fenton to Borneo , flying over 2,500 nautical miles ( 4,600 km ; 2,900 mi ) .
The airfield was abandoned at the end of World War II .
Over the years , it has reverted to the natural terrain from which it was built .
The base infrastructure is gone ; only concrete , building foundations , piles of rubble and occasional aircraft parts remain .
In aerial photographs , the remains of some roads that likely led to dispersed parts of the base , such as the bomb dump and the administrative containment area , are faintly visible , but no structures remain .

In parliamentary procedure , a motion to raise a question of privilege is a privileged motion that permits a request related to the rights and privileges of the assembly or any of its members to be brought up .
Explanation and Use In Robert 's Rules of Order Newly Revised ( RONR ) , questions of privilege affecting the assembly may include matters of comfort , amplification , or safety .
For example , it may be difficult to hear the speaker .
In this case , a question of privilege could be raised to close the doors and windows .
Such questions have precedence over questions of personal privilege should they conflict .
Otherwise , a question of privilege can only be interrupted by the motions to take a recess , adjourn , or fix the time to which to adjourn , or any incidental motions that must be disposed of at that time.When a question of privilege affects a single member ( rather than the entire assembly ) , it is called a question of personal privilege .
Such a question may include a need for assistance , to be excused for illness or personal emergency , or the need to immediately answer a charge of misconduct made by another member .
The member rises immediately and without waiting to be recognized states , " Mr. Chairman , I rise on a question of personal privilege , " or similar words .
If the member has interrupted a speaker , the chair must determine if the matter is of such urgency as demands immediate attention ; otherwise , the member will have the floor immediately after the current speaker is finished .
According to RONR , questions of personal privilege " seldom arise in ordinary societies and even more rarely justify interruption of pending business " .
An example of a question of privilege is a motion to go into executive session.A question of privilege can not interrupt a vote or the verification of a vote .

The MCW Metroliner was a coach built by Metro Cammell Weymann ( MCW ) in the 1980s .
The Metroliner was available as a standard single-deck coach , or the more numerous and striking tri-axle double-deck coach.The Metroliner saw service in the UK with nationalised operators National Bus Company ( NBC ) and Scottish Bus Group ( SBG ) for their long distance coach National Express and Scottish Citylink express services , as well as with competing operators such as Tyne & Wear PTE 's Armstrong Galley Clipper service and the London Buses/West Midland Travel London Liner joint operation .
Others saw operation with NBC subsidiaries ' commuter coach operations , such as the short-lived Kentish Express of Kentish Bus , Alder Valley and the Oxford Bus Company 's Oxford Citylink.Few Metroliners were purchased for touring or private hire work , although many were used for such duties after retiring from express duties .
Due to the limited demand for older double deck coaches and the high seating capacity on the upper deck , many double-deck Metroliner DR130s were converted to open-top buses by Ensignbus , for use on their London Pride Sightseeing operation , latterly passing to The Original Tour .
Variants and Production Numbers A total of 172 Metroliners were built , in four different variants .
CR126 Only 21 of the original style of single deck Metroliner were built in 1983-84 , 15 for NBC ( East Kent and Eastern National ) , 4 for SBG ( Eastern Scottish and Northern Scottish ) and 2 for Strathclyde PTE .
The final ten had a revised front with less angular styling .
DR130 The most numerous type of Metroliner was the early double deck DR130 design .
This was designed specifically for UK express services and thus differed from contemporary double deck coaches in its height .
Most such coaches are under 4m in height as this is the maximum permitted in continental Europe , but this severely limits the interior headroom .
The DR130 was higher , allowing a much more spacious interior , but making the design unsuitable for continental tours and limiting its appeal on the secondhand market.Some 127 Metroliner DR130s were built in 1983-87 , for NBC ( 102 , for numerous subsidiaries ) , SBG ( 12 for Eastern Scottish , Northern Scottish and Western Scottish ) including the prototype after its use as a demonstrator , Tyne & Wear PTE ( 6 ) , London Buses ( 4 ) and WMT Central Coachways ( 3 ) .
HR131 Sometimes known as the Hiliner or Metro-Hiliner , the HR131 featured a higher floor and than the original CR126 single deck coach .
All were built with the revised frontal styling .
Sales amounted to 21 which were built in 1983-88 .
The first vehicle was retained by MCW as a demonstrator , whilst original owners for the others were SBG ( 7 for Northern Scottish ) , NBC ( 6 for East Kent , East Midland and Wessex ) , Premier Travel ( 4 ) , Grampian ( 2 ) , and WMT Central Coachways ( 1 ) .
DR140 In an effort to broaden the appeal of the double deck coach a 4m high version was offered , with sleeker styling .
Known as the Metroliner 400GT this was the rarest variant with only three examples built in 1987-88 .
Two went to Central Coachways , one of which had initially been a demonstrator , whilst Yorkshire Traction took the third .

Yin Zhaohui ( born 1977 ) is an artist based in Beijing .
Background and Style Yin was born in Henan , China in 1977 .
Yin graduated from China ’s Central Academy of Fine Arts in 2004 .
Yin is a painter depicting ambiguous scenes of the human form .
Yin Zhaohui works mostly with oil paint on canvas .
His art consistently features subject matter of the human body , which is painted from photographs rather than real life .
Yin chooses not to paint from life in order to emphasize the degeneration and disconnect of reality when it is transferred to a photograph .
As the world has grown in consumerism and become more technologically advanced , artistic observers have been also shaped according to way in which society progresses .
Yin Zhaohui comments on the filter that observers bring in viewing things such as fine art as a result of what they are exposed to in the modern world .
This accounts for the lifeless , muted tone of his paintings .
One gets a sense of time in Yin ’s artwork ; the dead tone and shading of the images suggest the decay in an individual ’s sense of time .
Yin ’s paintings encourage the observer to go inward and contemplate their concept of self and their role as an observer in society .
Yin often focuses on the hands and face in his paintings , to further challenge the viewer ’s ideas about what is natural or real and what is not .
Yin also uses a grayscale palette and areas with forced lighting or diffused focus to further emphasize how we perceive these details of the natural human body .
The use of human hands and faces stresses an intimate theme in Yin 's paintings .
The face and the hands , especially in connection to each other , hold many emotional connotations , and both are used in one way or another as a portal to the inner self .
His modern art differs from the avant-garde style that many others utilize in China ; Yin chooses to retain classical topics and techniques that turn the viewer ’s attention to the inner self .
Brother Yin has a twin brother , Yin Zhaoyu , who displayed artwork alongside his brother in the exhibition “ Departures ” in 2008 at the Aura Gallery .
Yin Zhaoyu 's work most clearly reflected the title of the exhibit with his paintings that depict airports surrounded by a vast space .
Both artists " stick to classical techniques and themes . "
The brothers ' artwork has a hold on desolation and solitude .
While his brother ’s artwork involves a more broad perspective of the world , Yin Zhaohui ’s artwork has a more intimate focus .
Yin Zhaohui draws the viewer inward , and Yin Zhaoyu encourages the viewer to observe their vast surroundings .
Significant Works Untitled This piece which features what appears to be a close-up mass of entwined fingers is perhaps the single piece of artwork that is most recognizable of Yin Zhaohui ’s work , and most thoroughly represents his artistic style .
This oil on canvas painting was inspired by John Coplans ’ “ Self Portrait Fingers , ” a series of photographs that show Coplan ’s own hands in various sexually suggestive positions .
In this painting , Yin turns a natural and much-used part of the human body to communicate something that seems foreign and lack-luster .
The overall tone of the painting is a dull grey-blue hue , which evokes a sense of stagnancy .
Sexual undertones are also apparent in this piece , evidenced by Yin 's influence from John Coplans .

The United States occupation of the Mexican port of Veracruz lasted for seven months in 1914 and occurred in the midst of poor diplomatic relations between Mexico and the United States , related to the ongoing Mexican Revolution.In response to the Tampico Affair , President Woodrow Wilson ordered the U.S. Navy to prepare for the occupation of the port of Veracruz .
While waiting for authorization of Congress to carry out such action , Wilson was alerted to a German delivery of weapons for Victoriano Huerta due to arrive to the port on April 21 .
As a result , Wilson issued an immediate order to seize the port 's customs office and confiscate the weaponry.The Medal of Honor was created during the American Civil War and is the highest military decoration presented by the United States government to a member of its armed forces .
The recipient must have distinguished themselves at the risk of their own life above and beyond the call of duty in action against an enemy of the United States .
Due to the nature of this medal , it is commonly presented posthumously.Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels ordered that 56 Medals of Honor be awarded to participants in the occupation of Veracruz , the most for any single action before or since .
In total 63 Medals of Honor were received for actions during the occupation ; 1 Army , 9 to members of the United States Marine Corps and 53 to Navy personnel .

Rails with trails ( RWT ) are a small subset of rail trails in which a railway right-of-way remains in use by trains yet also has a parallel recreational trail .
Hundreds of kilometers of RWTs exist in Canada , Europe , the United States , and Western Australia .
United States In the United States the number of rails with trails is increasing .
As of 2000 , there were 1,000 rail trails in operation nationwide , comprising a total length of about 17,750 km / 11,029 mi .
Of those , 60 ( 387 km/240 mi ) were rails with trails , up from 37 ( 246 km/152 mi ) in 1996 .
Thus , on average United States rail trails are 11 miles ( 18 km ) long , but the small minority of rails with trails are 4 miles ( 6.4 km ) long.United States rails with trails with articles on Wikipedia : CaliforniaSonoma-Marin Area Rail TransitIllinoisGreen Bay TrailIndianaCalumet TrailMarylandWestern Maryland Scenic RailroadNew MexicoSanta Fe Southern RailwayOhioCamp Chase Trail/Camp Chase RailwayPennsylvaniaD & L TrailFive Star TrailSchuylkill River Trail Safety A 1997 study of the feasibility of rails with trails identified a need for guidelines concerning RWT crossings , fencing , setbacks , and other items .
These guidelines were developed in the form of Rails-with-Trails : Lessons Learned , which finds that " well-designed RWTs meet the operational needs of railroads , often providing benefits in the form of reduced trespassing and dumping .
A poorly designed RWT will compromise safety and function for both trail users and the railroad . "
A 1996 study of safety on rails with trails in the United States evaluated 37 existing RWTs in 16 states and concluded that " active railroad lines can function with an adjacent pedestrian , horse , and bike path without problem " and RWTs are " no more dangerous than rail-trails alone or next to busy streets .

Adrenaline is the first novel written by James Robert Baker ( 1946 -- 1997 ) , an American author of sharply satirical , predominantly gay-themed transgressional fiction .
History After graduating from UCLA , he began his career as a screenwriter , but became disillusioned and started writing novels instead .
After the controversy surrounding publication of his novel , Tim and Pete , he faced increasing difficulty having his work published.Adrenaline was published in 1985 under the pseudonym James Dillinger .
A story of two gay fugitive lovers on the run , it presaged the satire and drug fueled violence so prominent in his later books .
Here Baker began developing the themes that dominated his following works : anarchy ; angry and somewhat paranoid gay men ; the dark underside of Los Angeles , juxtaposed with its sunny outward image ; the hypocrisy of organized religion ; anonymous sex and its implications in the age of AIDS ; and homophobia and the oppression of gays in a Republican-dominated America .
Its plot device of underdog characters forced into flight due to circumstances beyond their control was one Baker explored in all of his subsequent work .
Plot summary A native Californian , his work is set almost entirely in Southern California , and the book is about two " lusty " gay lovers from Los Angeles named Nick and Jeff who at the beginning of the novel were having passionate sex when two " wildly homophobic cops " break in on them .
They fight back and while trying to defend themselves , they take one cop as hostage .
A SWAT team shows up and accidentally kills the cop hostage and blames the two lovers .
After that incident the two are on the run from the authorities throughout Los Angeles on the way to Mexico .
Reviews Planet Out noted the book as an " unapologetic jackhammer of anti-right , anti-homophobe , anti-corporate invective , despised by polite gays , embraced by activist queers , and garnered both hostile reviews and exuberant word-of-mouth . "
LaBlonte noted it " set the teeth of early AIDS activists on edge . "
The Los Angeles Times noted it as " over-the-top satire enthusiastically blending humor with rage and violence " .
James noted " Baker had many issues with the world at large , homophobic cops and preachers along with closeted Hollywood moguls , in particular , and he was able to find satisfaction in his novels that he could not find in real life " stemming from " pent up anger at the homophobic America at elected Ronald Reagan twice and sat by clucking their teeth while so many gay men died of AIDS . "
Gay Community News noted " he has an eye for the absurd , the quixotic , and the downright existential in pop culture " .
Subsequent works The modest success of the novel encouraged him to devote himself to what have become his best known works , Fuel-Injected Dreams ( a novel revolving around a character loosely based on record producer Phil Spector ) and Boy Wonder .
Though he garnered some fame for his books Fuel-Injected Dreams and Boy Wonder , according to his life partner the move to more mainstream novels instead of writing the fiction he wanted to create were a contributing factor in his suicide.Posthumously , Baker 's work has achieved cult status in the years since his death , and two additional novels have been posthumously published.As of 2006 , first editions of Adrenaline , Boy Wonder , Fuel-Injected Dreams and Tim and Pete have become collector 's items and command high prices at rare book stores .
First-edition copies of his earlier works have also become collector 's items .

Nicola Bronwyn Hayes v The Queen is a decision of the Supreme Court of New Zealand issued on 15 February 2008 .
It considered the meaning of ' pecuniary advantage ' in s 228 ( and the former s 229A ) of the Crimes Act 1961 .
The court further considered whether a belief one was acting honestly needed to be objectively reasonable for the purposes of these sections .
Composition of the court Elias CJ , Blanchard , Tipping , McGrath and Anderson JJ .
Reasons delivered by Tipping J. Background Hayes had been injured in a car accident in 1997 .
At the time she was working as a primary school teacher .
She applied for and received from the Accident Compensation Corporation weekly compensation .
She was paid for seven years , from time to time making declarations that she was still entitled to receive such payment.From late 1997 she helped run with her partner an effluent removal firm .
From 2001 onwards , when her partner was himself the victim of a car accident , the role included active physical work.In the high court , confirmed on appeal , it was found that at every relevant time Hayes made a declaration she was still medically entitled to weekly compensation , she acted contrary to ss 229A ( since repealed , but in force at the time for some of the relevant counts ) or 228 of the Crimes Act 1961 , in that she used a document with the intent to gain a pecuniary advantage.The appeal to the Supreme Court proceeded on two grounds .
Firstly that Hayes was not in receipt of a pecuniary advantage within the meaning of the statute .
When she reaffirmed her entitlement , no advantage was gained as she was already entitled to the compensation .
Secondly that the trial judge had erred in his directions on the requisite mens rea to make out the offence .
The judge had directed the jury that Hayes must have honestly and reasonably believed she was entitled to compensation .
Legislation The case turned on the interpretation of s 229A of the Crimes Act 1961 for 24 of the counts against Hayes , and the interpretation of s 228 for 5 of the counts against her .
These read as follows :229 A Taking or dealing with certain documents with intent to defraudEvery one is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years who , with intent to defraud , -- ( a ) Takes or obtains any document that is capable of being used to obtain any privilege , benefit , pecuniary advantage , or valuable consideration ; or ( b ) Uses or attempts to use any such document for the purpose of obtaining , for himself or for any other person , any privilege , benefit , pecuniary advantage , or valuable consideration .
... 228 Dishonestly taking or using documentEvery one is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years who , with intent to obtain any property , service , pecuniary advantage , or valuable consideration , -- ( a ) dishonestly and without claim of right , takes or obtains any document ; or ( b ) dishonestly and without claim of right , uses or attempts to use any document .
Decision Pecuniary advantage The Court of Appeal had followed a line of cases that said there was no pecuniary advantage where the accused obtained something to which she was entitled .
It was for the Crown to prove a lack of entitlement regardless of the accused 's intent .
This created problems in cases like this as under this construction it was arguable that the risk of losing a benefit was not the same obtaining an advantage.Tipping J preferred the following construction of pecuniary advantage " ... simply anything that enhances the accused 's financial position " .
Receiving an existing line of compensation would undoubtably fall into this definition .
This would be true even where the accused had a legal entitled to the money .
Everything turned on the accused acting dishonestly .
No need for a belief to be reasonable The defendant was of low intelligence .
She believed that her entitlement to compensation stemmed from not being paid to do the work she was employed to do prior to her accident .
It was argued that she therefore lacked the dishonest intent required by the statutes .
The trial judge had directed that the belief to entitlement needed to be honest and reasonable .
The Crown asserted this was either the correct direction on the plain reading of the statute or that , in line with other common law jurisdictions , the court ought to read in such a requirement.The Supreme Court rejected this argument .
The statute only required the belief to be actually held , although the reasonableness of the belief could go to the accused 's credibility .
This was however a question for the jury .
Result Hayes failed in her appeal on the first point but the direction on the reasonableness of the belief had resulted in a real danger there had been a miscarriage of justice .
The convictions were set aside .

Wavertree Botanic Gardens ( formerly Wavertree Botanic Garden and Park ) is an example of a mid 19th century public park .
It incorporates an earlier walled botanic garden , founded by William Roscoe as Liverpool Botanic Garden and relocated from land near Mount Pleasant in the 1830s .
The gardens include the Grade II curator 's lodge built between 1836-1837 .
On 20 November 1940 a stray German bomb caused all the glass in the botanic glasshouse to be broken , the plants inside were shredded .
As it was winter , everyone helped remove the surviving plants into nearby private glasshouses until the war ended .
The Orchids were located at Sudley House .
The botanic glasshouse was never reinstated after the war , but due to the major efforts by Percy Conn , the new Superintendent of Liverpool Parks , who had the vision to revive the work of William Roscoe & John Shepherd ( horticulturalist ) in the Mount Pleasant days , the Liverpool Botanic Garden arose anew in the Harthill Estate grounds at Calderstones Park.On 22 August 2013 the botanic park and gardens were listed at Grade II * in the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens .
In 1886 the International Exhibition of Navigation , Commerce and Industry was held here .

Saint Mary ( Persian : مریم مقدس , also Maryam al-Muqaddasah , Maryam Moghaddas , Maryam Adhraa Maryam Al-Muqadasa ; " The Honourable/Blessed Saint Mary " ) is a 1997 Iranian film by director Shahriar Bahrani , depicting the life of Mary mother of Jesus based on the Quran and Islamic tradition .
Plot In the year 16 BCE , the people of Jerusalem are awaiting the birth of the son of Imran .
Instead of the much-anticipated " Messiah " , a girl is born to Imran and Anna .
The latter names her Mary , which means " Servant of God " .
At the age of six , Mary is presented at the Temple , and remains there under the protection of the priest Zechariah until she turns sixteen.While in seclusion , Mary spends all of her time in labour and prayers , and is harassed by the Jewish priests .
She achieves such holiness that the angel Gabriel appears to her , foretelling that she will bear a holy man .
She later gives birth to Jesus .
Production The film bases the story of the life of Saint Mary and the birth of Jesus - a prophet in Islamic tradition on classical sources such as Chapter 19 of the Qur ' an .
Along with the character of Saint Mary , this film also featured the righteous character of the Prophet Zakariya , who in Islam was the guardian of Saint Mary.The two-hour-long film was originally in Persian but has been dubbed into English by the Wilayah Network which was recorded in Hong Kong by Red Angel Media , and there is also another version with English subtitles .
Footage from the film was used heavily in the 19 August 2007 British ITV documentary The Muslim Jesus .

By 1975 , almost 20 mobile classrooms had been erected at the new site in Stockwell Avenue as it now accommodated the majority of the school 's pupils .
A second building was added in 1977 as the Coppice Lane buildings were closed and the school was now located on the same site with a new name.The buildings on Coppice Lane were demolished soon afterwards and redeveloped for housing ; one for council housing , the other for private housing.Two more classroom blocks were added during the 1980s and the most recent building was opened in 1991 , by which time the school had 1,200 pupils following the first intake of 11-year-olds in September 1990 - the starting age for pupils in the local area had increased to 12 in 1972 .
It is named after Thorns Road ( A4036 ) .

Stonethwaite Beck is a minor river in Cumbria , England .
It is a tributary of the River Derwent.Stonethwaite Beck is formed at the confluence of Langstrath Beck and Greenup Gill beneath Eagle Crag , at Smithymire Island .
It continues north west and north through Galleny Force , past the villages of Stonethwaite and Rosthwaite , flowing into the Derwent in Borrowdale .
Karakeche ( or Kara-Keche ) is a village in Naryn Region of Kyrgyzstan .
It is the site of five open cast coal mines , source of around half of Kyrgyzstan 's national coal production with estimated reserves of 438 million tonnes .
This coal is mostly sent to Bishkek via the railway at Balykchy .
The extension of that railway all the way to Karakeche was proposed in 2013 while other reports have suggested that the mines might be offered to China in return for the construction of a trans-Kyrgyzstan railway linking Andijan , Uzbekistan with Kashgar , China .
History The Kara-Keche mines were developed during the Soviet era , with first production in 1985 .
After independence they were partly privatised , though the main mine remained under the 70 % state-owned firm Ak-Ulak .
According to news reports , local people believed that smaller privately owned operating companies , Joldoshbaev 's Besh-Sary , Isabaev 's Meerim-Sharbon and Sasykulov Ak-Jol , had asset stripped their respective operations and made little attempt to comply with basic financial or environmental standards .
Whether or not this was true , the mines were dramatically seized on 6 June 2005 by people claiming allegiance to the Joomart movement of Jumgal politician Nurlan Motuev , in what Motuev reportedly described as an attempt at redistribution of wealth relevant to the March revolution .
Motuev later served a prison sentence for the seizure , and in 2012 called for the mines ' nationalisation .

The following sortable table comprises the 200 highest mountain peaks of the United States with at least 500 meters ( 1640 feet ) of topographic prominence.The summit of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways : The topographic elevation of a summit measures the height of the summit above a geodetic sea level.The topographic prominence of a summit is a measure of how high the summit rises above its surroundings.The topographic isolation ( or radius of dominance ) of a summit measures how far the summit lies from its nearest point of equal elevation.In the United States , only Denali exceeds 6000 meters ( 19,685 feet ) elevation .
Four major summits exceed 5000 meters ( 16,404 feet ) , nine exceed 4500 meters ( 14,764 feet ) , 104 exceed 4000 meters ( 13,123 feet ) , 220 exceed 3500 meters ( 11,483 feet ) , and 302 major summits exceed 3000 meters ( 9843 feet ) elevation .
Highest major summits Of these 200 highest major summits of the United States , 88 are located in Colorado , 49 in Alaska , 22 in California , 14 in Wyoming , eight in New Mexico , five in Utah , four in Nevada , three in Montana , two in Washington , two in Hawaiʻi , two in Idaho , and one in Arizona .
Five of these peaks lie on the international border between Alaska and Yukon , and two lie on the international border between Alaska and British Columbia .
The ten highest major summits of the United States are all located in Alaska .

Milton King Alexander ( January 3 , 1796 -- July 7 , 1856 ) was an American politician and militia officer who served during the War of 1812 , the Seminole Wars and , most notably , as a brigadier general during the Black Hawk War .
Early life Born to John Brown Alexander and Barbara King in Elbert County , Georgia , he moved with his family to Williamson County , Tennessee in 1804 and , seven years later , moved to Lincoln , Tennessee.During the War of 1812 , he served with the Tennessee Mounted Volunteers under General Andrew Jackson and eventually rose to the rank of first lieutenant remaining with Jackson until the capture of Pensacola on November 6 , 1814 .
As Jackson left to prepare the defense of New Orleans , Alexander stayed behind in Florida .
He later served with Jackson during the First Seminole War , however he was discharged after becoming too ill for active duty.Returning to Tennessee , he married Mary Shields and lived in Giles County for several years before moving to the Illinois Territory in 1823 .
Settling in Paris , Illinois , he became involved in farming and mercantilism before being appointed the town 's first postmaster , a position he would hold for the next twenty-five years.In February 1826 , he would become appointed Clerk of the County Commissioner 's Court .
He would hold this position until September 1827 , when he resigned to accept a commission in the Illinois Militia from Governor Edward Coles as a Colonel in the 19th Regiment Illinois Militia .
He was eventually appointed an aide-de-camp to Governor John Reynolds in December 1831 and , shortly before trouble began to appear on the frontier , he was required to go with Reynolds to Rock Island early the following year .
Service during the Black Hawk War During the first weeks of June 1832 , he was one of hundreds of volunteers to report at Dixon 's Ferry as General Henry Atkinson was organizing a second campaign against Black Hawk .
On June 16 , Alexander Posey and Milton Alexander were elected by the brigades they helped organize to command , respectively , the First and Second Illinois Militias.In the aftermath of the Second Battle of Kellogg 's Grove , Alexander was ordered by Atkinson to search the banks below the Galena in order to prevent a possible retreat of Black Hawk 's band across the Mississippi River .
However , after a fruitless search , Alexander continued along the eastern side of Rock River with Colonel Jacob Fry until reaching a Winnebago village on Whitewater , a tributary of Rock River .
Rejoining General Atkinson at Lake Koshkonong on June 3 , they were joined by General Posey and Colonel Henry Dodge the following day.That evening , Atkinson received a report from scouts that they had located the main trail three miles upriver and the main force set out to investigate early the next morning .
With Alexander and Dodge searching the west bank of Rock River , they traveled 15 miles before turning back finding no trace of Black Hawk 's band.Eventually running low on provisions , he was sent to get supplies from Fort Winnebago with General Henry and Colonel Dodge .
While there , they received news that Black Hawk had been sighted in the area and it was decided that Dodge and Henry would pursue Black Hawk while Alexander would return to the main force with the supplies.At the Battle of Bad Axe , he and Posey led the right flank and was part of the final charge with Dodge , Henry and Posey which ended the battle .
His brigade suffered no casualties with the exception of one soldier who was wounded .
Later years Following the war , he resumed his duties as postmaster and , in 1837 , he was elected by the joint vote of the General Assembly of Illinois to serve as a member of Board of Commissioners of Public Works .
He was also a longtime member of the Presbyterian Church.A prominent member of the community , Alexander was also an acquaintance of Abraham Lincoln when he practiced law in Edgar County , Illinois during the early 1850s .
Due to the disease he contracted as a soldier in Florida , he remained an invalid during the last ten years of his life .
He eventually died on July 7 , 1856 .

Nonoalco ( 1971 -- 1992 ) was an American-bred Thoroughbred racehorse who raced in France .
Background He was out of the mare Seximee , a daughter of the 1954 Preakness Stakes winner Hasty Road .
His sire was the very important Nearctic , who also sired Northern Dancer , the 1964 Kentucky Derby , Preakness Stakes and Queen 's Plate winner , who became the most influential sire of the 20th century.Nonoalco was bred by American chocolate magnate Forrest Mars , whose mother Ethel V. Mars was a major Thoroughbred owner/breeder through her Milky Way Farm .
Nonoalco was purchased and raced by María Félix , a Mexican actress and wife of French financier Alex Berger .
Racing career Trained by François Boutin , at age two Nonoalco had an outstanding year in racing .
He won the Prix Yacowlef , Prix Morny and the Prix de la Salamandre , plus he finished second in the Grand Critérium to Nelson Bunker Hunt 's colt , Mississipian.As a three-year-old , he won the British Classic , the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket Racecourse , beating the odds-on favourite Apalachee into third place .
In France , he captured the Prix du Rond Point and the Prix Jacques Le Marois .
Stud career Retired to stud having won four Group One races , Nonoalco stood in France in 1975 and in Ireland from 1976 through 1981 before being shipped to Japan , where he stood until his death at age twenty-one in 1992 .
His offspring met with modest success on the track .

A Braitenberg vehicle is a concept conceived in a thought experiment by the Italian-Austrian cyberneticist Valentino Braitenberg.The motion of the vehicle is directly controlled by some sensors ( for example photo cells ) .
Yet the resulting behaviour may appear complex or even intelligent .
Mechanism A Braitenberg vehicle is an agent that can autonomously move around based on its sensor inputs .
It has primitive sensors that measure some stimulus at a point , and wheels ( each driven by its own motor ) that function as actuators or effectors .
In the simplest configuration , a sensor is directly connected to an effector , so that a sensed signal immediately produces a movement of the wheel.Depending on how sensors and wheels are connected , the vehicle exhibits different behaviors ( which can be goal-oriented ) .
This means that , depending on the sensor-motor wiring , it appears to strive to achieve certain situations and to avoid others , changing course when the situation changes.The connections between sensors and actuators for the simplest vehicles ( 2 and 3 ) can be ipsilateral or contralateral , and excitatory or inhibitory , producing four combinations with different behaviours named ; fear , aggression and liking , and love .
Examples The following examples are some of Braitenberg 's simplest vehicles .
Vehicle 1 A first agent has one sensor ( e.g. light-detector ) that directly stimulates its single wheel in an excitatory way .
The vehicle can standstill or move forward .
The behaviour of this vehicle can be interpreted as : More light produces faster movement.Less light produces slower movement.Darkness produces standstill.This behavior can be understood as a creature that is afraid of the light and that moves fast to get away from it .
Its goal is to find a dark spot to hide .
Vehicle 2a A slightly more complex agent has two ( left and right ) symmetric sensors ( e.g. light detectors ) each stimulating a wheel on the same side of the body .
This vehicle represent a model of negative animal tropotaxis .
It obeys the following rule : More light right → right wheel turns faster → turns towards the left , away from the light.This is more efficient as a behavior to escape from the light source , since the creature can move in different directions , and tends to orient towards the direction from which least light comes.In another variation , the connections are negative or inhibitory : more light → slower movement .
In this case , the agents move away from the dark and towards the light .
Vehicle 2b The agent has the same two ( left and right ) symmetric sensors ( e.g. light detectors ) , but each one stimulating a wheel on the other side of the body .
It obeys the following rule : More light left → right wheel turns faster → turns towards the left , closer the light.As a result , the robot follows the light ; it moves to be closer to the light .
Behavior In a complex environment with several sources of stimulus , Braitenberg vehicles will exhibit complex and dynamic behavior.Depending on the connections between sensors and actuators , a Braitenberg vehicle might move close to a source , but not touch it , run away very fast , or describe circles or figures-of-eight around a point.This behavior is undoubtedly goal-directed , flexible and adaptive , and might even appear to be intelligent , the way some minimal intelligence is attributed to a cockroach .
Yet , the functioning of the agent is purely mechanical , without any information processing or other apparently cognitive processes.Often , BEAM robotics implements these sorts of behaviors .

‹ See Tfd › Kent/Sussex Detoxification Center , is a state funded , 20 bed medical facility in the SAMSHA Drug and Alcohol Rehab Programs category .
The facility is located in Ellendale , Delaware in the former Ellendale public school on Main Street .
This facility is one of only two detoxification centers in the state , with the other being Kirkwood Detox Center .
In 2005 , the facility serviced an average of 14.8 patients per day and in 2006 the facility serviced an average of 12.2 patients per day.The detox center was a part of a controversy in September 2006 when a man called the medical facility to learn about being admitted for alcohol abuse .
When the staff learned he only had Medicaid , he was denied treatment as the state-funded facility did not accept Medicaid at that time .
Two days later , his body was discovered as he had hanged himself in his backyard the night he had been denied entry into the program .

The Dodrill -- GMR machine was the first operational mechanical heart successfully used while performing open heart surgery .
It was developed by Dr. Forest Dewey Dodrill , a surgeon at Harper University Hospital in Detroit , and General Motors Research.On July 3 , 1952 , 41-year-old Henry Opitek suffering from shortness of breath made medical history at Harper University Hospital in Michigan .
The Dodrill -- GMR heart machine , considered by some to be the first operational mechanical heart was successfully used while performing heart surgery .
The machine performs the functions of the heart , allowing doctors to detour blood and stop the heart of a patient during an operation .
The machine is external of the body and is only used during an operation .
Dr. Forest Dewey Dodrill , a surgeon at Wayne State University ’s Harper Hospital in Detroit , developed the machine with funding from The American Heart Association and volunteer engineers from General Motors.Dr .
Dodrill used the machine in 1952 to bypass Henry Opitek ’s left ventricle for 50 minutes while he opened the patient 's left atrium and worked to repair the mitral valve .
In Dodrill ’s post operative report he notes , “ To our knowledge , this is the first instance of survival of a patient when a mechanical heart mechanism was used to take over the complete body function of maintaining the blood supply of the body while the heart was open and operated on .

Rathgormack GAA is a GAA club based in the Rathgormack region of County Waterford .
Originally two clubs , Clonea-Power and Rathgormack amalgamated in 1987 to form one club .
History Rathgormack GAA Club is a gaelic football club which is assisted by Clonea Hurling Club , both club 's which are in the parish of Clonea and Rathgormack .
This arrangement between the two clubs was put in place in 1989 .
Football was played in the village of Rathgormack before the foundation of the GAA in 1884 .
It was one of the first parts of Waterford to be affiliated to the organisation .
History In the late 1880s and 1890s the club was officially known as the " Clodagh Campaigners " denoting the national feelings of the time-Parnell and the land league and the river that flows through the parish.County Senior Football Honours came Rathgormacks way in 1909 and again in 1910 , 1912 , 1913 and 1918 .
They contested Senior finals in 1920 , 1924 and 1930 without success.The club went a number of decades without senior success but did win the 1934 Junior Title and in 1935 brought home the first County Minor Football title to the parish.Two football clubs existed in the district between 1936 and 1940 and met once in the first round of the 1936 championship.The club went into a decline in the 1940s , but came back again .
Revival signs occurred in the 1960s and in 1963 Junior Football Divisional Honours came back to Rathgormack and was followed in 1964 by County success.During the 70 's intermediate triumph was achieved .
The club did not always confine itself to football and the club 's hurling team won Divisional Honours at junior level in 1977 .
The club acquired its own property in 1982 , and it was declared officially open on 2 June 1984 ( Centenary Year ) and it was a unique project at the time , being clear of debt .
In 1984 , the club won the County Intermediate title to regain its Senior Status , which it has maintained since.In the 1990s the Club concentrated solely on football while its sister club Clonea concentrated on hurling .
Both clubs along with the parish of Windgap continue to assist each other in both codes .
The club regained the premier title and brought home the Conway Cup after a lapse of 9 decades in the 1990s .
County Final wins also came their way in 1995 at the expense of neighbours Kilrossanty , Gaultier a year later and a win over Stradbally in the 1999 decider.Nowadays the club lends its support to a Ladies Football Team , Comeragh Rangers.In 2005 the club grounds were re-developed and officially named and dedicated to the memory of Johnny Curry.As part of the GAA 's 125 year celebrations , the club launched a book on football in Rathgormack , ' The Spirit of Rathgormack - The History of Football in Rathgormack 1884 - 2009 ' .

‹ See Tfd › The Misiones Orientales ( Eastern missions ) ( Spanish ) or Sete Povos das Missões / Siete Pueblos de las Misiones ( Seven Peoples of the Missions ) ( Portuguese ) are a historic region in South America , in present-day Rio Grande do Sul , the southernmost State of Brazil.Together with present-day Misiones Province in Argentina and Misiones Department in Paraguay it formed the Jesuit Reductions between 1609 and 1756 , an almost fully independent territory created and ruled by the Spanish Catholic order of the Jesuits .
It was famous for its resistance to enslavement and its egalitarian laws based on the Bible .
The seven missions were called San Miguel , Santos Angeles , San Lorenzo Martir , San Nicolas , San Juan Bautista , San Luis Gonzaga , and San Francisco de Borja.The King of Spain was the nominal ruler of these lands and in the Treaty of Madrid ( 1750 ) he gave the eastern part of the Jesuit Reductions to Portugal .
The seven Jesuit missions here were to be dismantled and relocated on the Spanish western side of the Uruguay River .
The Guarani people living there refused , which led to the Guarani War , won by Portugal and Spain.The territory returned to Spain in 1777 in the First Treaty of San Ildefonso , but was definitively ceded to Portugal in the Treaty of Badajoz ( 1801 ) .
It became part of Brazil when this country gained its independence from Portugal in 1822 .

Cité Aline Sitoe Diatta is a neighborhood in west central Dakar , Senegal .
Overview Formerly known as Cité Claudel , after independence the area was named after Aline Sitoe Diatta , an anti-colonial leader from Casamance .
Although the name has changed , many still refer to the area as Claudel or Fann .
Cité Aline Sitoe Diatta is the home of Cheikh Anta Diop University , and consequently hosts a large , vibrant ( and often crowded ) student community .
Just west of the prosperous Medina neighborhood and bordered by the ocean Corniche road and Point Fann , in the early 20th century the area was military drill ground , called the " Champ de Fann " , which later became a sports ground .
Administratively , it is part of Dakar Plateau , the city center .
As it lies at the conjunction of the University area and the government and business center of the nation , it is often the scene of student protests .

Those of Irish ancestry have had a strong impact on the city of Indianapolis , Indiana .
In total , they are the second largest ethnic group in Indianapolis .
Antebellum Most of the Irish immigrants to Indianapolis settled originally on east coast cities , but gradually moved westward to find better employment opportunities .
With internal improvements seen as one way toward development in 1832 , the Indianapolis newspaper Indiana Journal advertised for Irish workers to come work for the Wabash and Erie Canal , enticing them with $ 10 a month wages and cheap land .
The Mammoth Internal Improvement Act defined the expectation of several Irish workers being available to work on such projects as the Indiana Central Canal and the National Road .
However , once the Panic of 1837 struck , many Irish became unemployed.The 1840s saw the Irish begin to form small communities within the city , especially in the same poorer areas that free blacks resided .
They created what would become St. John Catholic Church in 1840 , after celebrating their first Catholic Mass in 1837 at a tavern on West Washington Street .
Greater numbers of Irish came during the decade due to the Irish Potato Famine , and relief efforts were started by the Indianapolis Irish to support those still in Ireland .
War years At the start of the War , the Irish in Indianapolis mostly resided at Irish Hill , which gained a reputation as the toughest part of town , and Fountain Square .
These areas tended to be next to railroad and streetcar lines , which relied on Irish workers .
Other major employers of the Irish were construction and pork-packing .
At the start of the War , the Indianapolis Irish formed the 35th Regiment , also called the 1st Irish Regiment , recruited at the parish school of St. John 's .
They would later be combined with the 61st Regiment/2nd Irish Regiment .
Some of the Irish , particularly those that belonged to the Irish Republican Brotherhood ( Fenians ) thought the War would be good practice for eventually fighting Great Britain .
Two rival chapters of the Fenians in Indianapolis recruited 150 Irish veterans to invade Canada from Buffalo , New York , in hopes of severing Canada from Great Britain in May 1866 .
All Fenians who attempted this , including the 150 from Indianapolis , were arrested under orders of President Andrew Johnson on June 6 , 1866 .
Post-war By 1870 , Indianapolis was the home of over 3,300 foreign-born Irish , with the total being 3,760 for all of Marion County .
This saw the Irish attain greater political power in Indianapolis local affairs .
Although the first two Irish mayors of Indianapolis , John Caven and Daniel MaCauley , were of the Republican Party , as a whole the Irish of Indianapolis sides with the Democrats , especially since the Republicans were the party of blacks , and Irish were opposed to them .
This led to a racial riot on May 3 , 1876 , when in response to Irish Democrats intimidating black voters in Ward 6 , a base of Irish Democrats in Indianapolis , 100 blacks from Ward 4 went to Ward 6 , seizing hockey sticks to attack the Irish intimidators .
The crowd was eventually dispersed by the city police and Mayor Caven , but not after gunfire was begun .
Several blacks were injured , with one dying due to the riot .
It was the worse in the city 's history .
1900s In 1910 the Irish population in Indianapolis was 12,225 , of which 3,255 were born in Ireland , composing 5 % of the total population of Indianapolis , and 15 % of its immigrant population .
During World War I the Irish would side with the city 's German population in denouncing the Allies , due to their hatred of Great Britain .
Today An annual event called the Indy Irish Fest occurs every September .
On St. Patrick 's Day , not only is there a parade , but the Indiana Central Canal is dyed green to celebrate the holiday.There are also the Irish Dancers of Indianapolis , that celebrate the dancing of Ireland .

Don Quixote ( 1933 ) is the English title of a film adaptation of the classic Miguel de Cervantes novel , directed by Georg Wilhelm Pabst , starring the famous operatic bass Feodor Chaliapin .
Although the film stars Chaliapin , it is not an opera .
However , he does sing four songs in it .
It is the first sound film version of the Spanish classic .
The supporting cast in the English version includes George Robey , René Donnio , Miles Mander , Lydia Sherwood , Renée Valliers , and Emily Fitzroy .
The film was made in three versions -- French , English , and German -- with Chaliapin starring in all three versions.The producers separately commissioned five composers ( Jacques Ibert , Maurice Ravel - who wrote three songs - , Marcel Delannoy , Manuel de Falla and Darius Milhaud ) to write the songs for Chaliapin .
Each composer believed only he had been approached.Ibert 's music was chosen for the film , but this caused him some embarrassment as he was a close friend of Ravel 's .
Ravel considered a lawsuit against the producers .
He dropped the action , and the two composers remained close friends .
EMI released excerpts from the soundtrack of the French version on 78-rpm and LP discs .
Changes to plot The film condenses the novel significantly and scrambles up the order of Don Quixote 's adventures .
There are several changes .
Don Quixote is " dubbed " a knight not by an innkeeper , but by a traveling actor who is appearing as a king in a play that Don Quixote mistakenly believes to be real .
As in the later 1957 Russian film version of the novel , the attack on the windmills is moved to near the end of the film .
The mill workers are seen returning from their labor , and unlike the novel , Don Quixote is caught up by the windmill but not thrown .
The windmill is stopped by the mill workers , who then assist Sancho in carrying Quixote down.The final scene is the most radically changed of all .
Totally defeated , and brought home imprisoned in a cage , Don Quixote sees that his niece , the village priest , and Sanson Carrasco ( who in this version is the niece 's fiancee , as in Man of La Mancha ) have burnt his beloved books of chivalry .
The shock literally kills Don Quixote ; he collapses and dies in Sancho 's arms , while the townsfolk , who only a few moments prior , were laughing and jeering at him as he sat in the cage , are deeply moved and now kneel in respect for the dead " knight " .
In a bit of trick photography , the pages of the original 1605 edition of Cervantes 's novel arise from the flames rather than being consumed by them - a sign that Don Quixote has achieved immortality.Dulcinea , who appears in the film , is depicted as a not-too-bright milkmaid , and cruelly , she is among those who laugh the hardest when Don Quixote is brought back in a cage.Don Quixote 's name is Don Quixote in this version .
He is never referred to as Alonso Quixano .
Trick photography in the film The film makes several striking early uses of trick photography .
Immediately after the opening credits , we see a page of a medieval romance , and the figures on it seem to come to animated life .
( This is deleted on some prints . )
The windmill sequence , in which Don Quixote is lifted into the air by the sails , gives the impression that Chaliapin himself has been caught up by the windmill , not a dummy or a stunt double .
It is an impressive achievement by 1933 standards , and was imitated both in the 1957 screen version of Cervantes ' novel and in the 1972 film version of Man of La Mancha .
And the scene in which the pages of the novel seemingly arise from the flames has already been mentioned .
Cannes The film was screened out of competition at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival.The French and English versions were released on DVD on 30 May 2006 by Video Artists International .

Rodolfo Chikilicuatre ( Spanish pronunciation : [ roˈðolfo tʃikiliˈkwatɾe ] ; born 1972 ) ; is a Spanish comedic character played by David Fernández Ortiz ( born 24 June 1970 ) and first introduced in the Spanish late night show Buenafuente as an improvisational act .
Rodolfo was interviewed as the inventor of the vibrator-guitar .
The character rose to fame after he was later presented by the show 's host , Andreu Buenafuente , with a song called " Baila el Chiki-chiki " ( Dance the Chiki-chiki ) , a parody of reggaeton music filled with jokes and political references , and the show 's host decided to enter the song into the Spanish selection process for the Eurovision Song Contest 2008 .
Rodolfo landed Spain 's best placement since Eurovision Song Contest 2004 .
Eurovision Song Contest 2008 and " Baila el Chiki-chiki " For the Eurovision Song Contest 2008 , the Spanish broadcaster RTVE decided to make the song selection process more democratic , so , in an agreement with MySpace , a webpage was created where the general public could vote for any of the artists who were interested in participating , possibly discovering new talents .
Any aspiring singer could upload a video to enter the contest .
The top 5 voted videos , along with 5 more entries selected by a jury , went to a televised final where the Spanish Eurovision Song Contest 2008 entry would be chosen.More than 530 songs were submitted , the comedic act of Rodolfo Chikilicuatre and his " Baila el Chiki-chiki " song among them .
The song was heavily promoted by late night show Buenafuente and television channel La Sexta that aired the show , and ended up being selected by a landslide , earning 56.28 % of the votes , well ahead of the runner-up , which earned only 14.6 % .
The winner was chosen through text messaging.This selection was met with a certain degree of controversy , as many considered it a gimmick song , and not worthy of representing Spain .
It also met controversy because Rodolfo Chikilicuatre was a comedic act , with no prior songs , and was backed by a particular show ( Buenafuente ) and a private broadcaster ( LaSexta ) .
RTVE stood by their choice of voting system.On March 11 , 2008 , Rodolfo announced some changes to the lyrics of his song to comply with the rules of the Eurovision Song Contest , thus removing partially the names of the politicians included in the song ( José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero , Hugo Chávez and Mariano Rajoy ) .
Even if Chávez 's name was completely removed , a reference to a previous incident with King Juan Carlos I of Spain was kept .
A non-political reference to Serbia was added .
The song was also made longer , as the original was considered too short , going from 1:20 to 2:56 minutes , and several verses in English were added .
The new version was presented on March 14 , 2008 .
Rodolfo performed the " Chiki-chiki " theme with other singers : King Africa , Tata Golosa , Mojinos Escozios and Dustin the Turkey.During the final contest of the Eurovision 2008 on May 24 , 2008 , the song " Baila el Chiki-chiki " reached sixteenth place with 55 points , tied with Albania .

Bavington Hall is a 17th-century privately owned country house at Little Bavington in Northumberland .
It is a Grade II * listed building.A tower house ( Little Bavington Tower ) was recorded on the site in 1415 , but this was replaced in the late 17th century by the Shafto family.The Shaftos acquired the estate when William Shafto married the Bavington heiress in the 15th century .
In 1716 William Shafto and his son John were attainted for their part in the Jacobite uprising of 1715 and the estate was forfeited and sold by the Crown to Admiral George Delaval .
On his death Delaval restored the property to the Shafto family by bequeathing the estate to his brother-in-law George Delaval Shafto ( High Sheriff of Northumberland 1739 and Member of Parliament for Northumberland 1757-74 ) .
Significant alterations and improvements to the three-storeyed , seven-bayed house were carried out in 1720 , 1851 and 1930 .
The Shafto family sold the property in 1994 .
The present owners offer holiday accommodation in cottages in the grounds .
The grounds contain a grotto , statues and other features which are Grade II listed .

‹ See Tfd › Convention over Code is a design approach for programming languages where the conventional use of a feature is taken into consideration when defining the default semantics of the feature .
Similar to Convention over Configuration , if a keyword can be implied by its absence due to convention , it becomes less a part of the idea the coder is expressing and a part of the hidden implementation.A common , notorious example is found in Java and C# .
We find the keyword public infused throughout a typical Java code excerpt , and in the case of methods it implies public scope access .
In practice , more methods use public scope access than the other three : private , protected and package protected ( which happens to be the actual Java default ) .
While a matter of opinion and much debate by programmers that love to be explicit about everything , it is clear that leaving out scope access keywords altogether takes very little away from the actual expression of an idea in code , because it has nothing to do with the idea at all , it is an attribute of the implementation of an idea.Convention over Code means we would make public the default for methods , and make better use of keyword Huffman coding in language design .

An armored car ( or armored cash transport car , security van ) is an armored van or truck , used in transporting valuables , such as large quantities of money ( especially for banks or retail companies ) .
The armored car is typically a multifunctional vehicle designed to protect and ensure the well being of the transported individuals and/or contents .
Often , armored cars are bulletproof and can withstand extreme degrees of heat .
These vehicles mostly utilized by the military , but many companies such as Mercedes , Lexus , Toyota , Cadillac , Audi , and BMW have created armored cars for civilian use , usually to protect valuables and dignitaries .
Armored cars have an armored shell and cab , and typically are customized on a basic van or truck chassis .
These vehicles are designed to resist attempts at robbery and hijacking .
Bullet-resistant glass and reinforced shells and cabs are designed to resist bullets from most handguns and rifles .
They may or may not be manned by armed guards .
Such armored cars are usually operated by security firms , and are therefore often referred to as " security vans " .
History The idea of the armored vehicle dates back to Leonardo da Vinci 's sketches of an armored war vehicle , in 1485 .
It consisted of a circular platform on four wheels with light cannons arranged facing out .
This design , however , proved to be flawed.The earliest form of armored transportation for valuables that actually went into production were the " ironclad " treasure wagons designed by the Cheyenne and Black Hills Stage Company during the American Old West .
Back then , a platoon of soldiers and cavalrymen were used to transport valuables such as gold safely across the lawless frontier .
They were not always successful in escorting their valuables and some robbers managed to hold up and rob these transports , such as what happened in the Wham Paymaster robbery and the Skeleton Canyon massacres .
In Deadwood , the Cheyenne and Black Hills Stage Company suffered robberies along the criminal-infested Deadwood to Cheyenne trail that also resulted in the death of one of their shotgun messengers named Johnny Slaughter .
In order to deter bandits and prevent future robberies , the Stage Company built two steel-plated treasure coaches named Slaughter ( after the former shotgun messenger ) and Monitor ( after the famous USS Monitor in the Civil War ) .
The stagecoaches had 5/16th-inch thick steel plates , portholes for guards to shoot from , and inside of each coach was a strongbox with walls three inches thick that was bolted to the floor , and was said to be able to resist assaults for 24 hours .
Although the stage coaches were impenetrable , they still left its driver and shotgun messenger unprotected .
On September 26 , 1878 , the Monitor was attacked by the Charles Carey Gang as it left Deadwood .
The gang killed one of the passengers , stopped the carriage and took over $ 27,000 worth of gold and valuables.Among the first armored cars built was the Bellamore Armored Motor Bank Car , of 1910 , which was meant to function like the banking service armored cars of today , but also as a mobile bank branch .
It was built on an Autocar Type XXI truck .
It was not until Rolls-Royce came out with the Rolls-Royce Ghost in August 1914 that the first armored vehicle was introduced to the British military .
The vehicle proved to be superior during the war , creating a demand for armored cars across the globe .
In 1930 , Mercedes Benz introduced the Nurburg 460 , which was an armored car used to protect Pope Pius XI .
As the armored car became more and more popular , vehicle manufacturers around the world started creating their own versions .
Industrial business use Financial industry : the armored car is used to transport money from one destination to another safely .
This benefits the bank because it gives the bank employees more time to work with the customers , and provides a security net to the owner knowing their money is in good hands.Education industry : schools utilize the armored car for safely transporting money made by school fund raisers or cafeteria profits .
Many universities have within their confines a university bank , and they may require the use of an armored car to handle large amounts of money.Jewelry industry : many jewelers such as Jared , Kay , Rogers and Hollands , and Tiffany Co utilize armored cars to transport their valuable jewelry safely to their stores .
Jewelers work with precious metals and valuable gemstones , and they need to make sure that their work can be safely carried to the person who has ordered it .
Vehicles An armored shell and cab are customized on a basic van or truck chassis .
These vehicles are designed to resist attempts at robbery and hijacking .
Bullet-resistant glass and reinforced shells and cabs are designed to handle bullets from most handguns and rifles .
Traffic safety and security Some armored cars in certain countries may be cleared to have flashing warning lights or sirens .
Most armored cars have a bull bar or extra strong bumper to ram blockades or other road objects if under attack .
They normally have CCTV cameras which are watched by the driver , recorded in the van and also recorded at a remotely located control room in case the in-van recordings are stolen by thieves or attackers .
Access control A number of tools are applied to prevent access to the van by non-security staff including removing external door locks.The vehicle may or may not be manned by armed guards .
Such armored cars are usually operated by security firms , and are therefore often referred to as " security vans " .
Guards Most armored cars have two to three occupants : A driver , who is normally never allowed to leave the vehicle until it returns to the garageOne or two guards who deliver the cash or valuablesDepending on the jurisdiction , the guards are armed .
Most guards carry handguns , submachine guns or assault rifles ; These guards are required to have training before they can carry them.Six member states of the European Union prohibit weapons during cash-in-transit ( CIT ) operations.Some are also required to wear bullet-proof vests and sometimes helmets .

Other uses Despite their primary function as a safe means to transport valuable materials from one place to another , armored cars are occasionally used for other purposes .
For example , during the 1997 North Hollywood shootout , police officers in Los Angeles commandeered an armored car in order to extract wounded civilians and officers from the scene towards the end of the shootout .
This later led to the introduction of specialist police vehicles for similar situations .

The comparative case ( abbreviated COMP ) is a grammatical case used in languages such as Mari and Chechen to mark a likeness to something.It is not to be confused with the comparative degree , a much more widely used paradigm used to signify heightening of adjectives and adverbs.In Mari , the comparative case is marked with the suffix - ла ( ' - la ' ) For example , if something were to taste like fish ( кол - ' kol ' ) , the form used would be колла - ' kolla ' ) .
It is also used in regard to languages , when denoting the language a person is speaking , writing , or hearing .
Then , however , the accentuation varies slightly from the standard case .
Usually , the suffix is not stressed .
When it is used with languages , however , it is stressed.In Chechen , it is marked with the suffix - l. For example , sha is ' ice ' , shiila is ' cold ' , and shal shiila is ' cold as ice ' .

Giacomo Michael " Jackie " Aprile Sr. , played by Michael Rispoli , is a fictional character on the HBO original series The Sopranos .
He was the first acting boss of the DiMeo Crime Family , after longtime reputed boss Ercole ' Eckley ' DiMeo was sent to prison in 1995 .
He is loosely based on DeCavalcante crime family acting mob boss Giacomo " Jake " Amari .
Plot details According to Sopranos ; A Family History , Giacomo Michael Aprile Sr. was born in 1955 , was a close friend and contemporary of Tony Soprano and they came up through the ranks of the DiMeo Crime Family together .
Jackie 's older brother , Richie Aprile , also stepped up in the same crime family .
Jackie was also the brother of Liz La Cerva and thus the uncle of Adriana La Cerva .
Jackie and Tony , along with Silvio Dante and Ralph Cifaretto , were in their own small crew when they were younger moving weed and stolen goods .
Around this time , Jackie had the idea to rob a card game held by capo Feech La Manna in order to make a name for themselves .
After Jackie and Tony robbed the game , their brother and father respectively , intervened and returned some of the stolen money .
Despite the robbery , both Tony and Jackie became rising stars in the crime family and were on the fast track to being made men.Jackie 's star rose considerably in the intervening years , during which he started a family .
He married Rosalie Aprile , and they had three children together .
Jackie never wanted his son Jackie Aprile Jr. to get involved in the Mafia , despite his success .
He and his older brother , Richie , appointed Aprile crew associate , Peter " Beansie " Gaeta , to peddle heroin for them , taking the largest cut for themselves .
At some point Jackie served time in prison in Lewisberg with the later identified informant Fabian " Febby " Petrullio .
Tony said that Jackie did ' a couple of counts ' in jail , suggesting that although he served prison time , he avoided any long sentences.In 1990 , Jackie became acting capo of the Aprile Crew following the imprisonment of his older brother .
By the mid-1990s his influence , power and success continued to expand and he assumed the role of acting boss while Ercole ' Eckley ' DiMeo went on trial and was subsequently sentenced to life in prison in 1995 .
He was considered an all-powerful figure in the crime family and was liked and respected by all his peers .
Although Jackie ran the family , he never took the official boss title from DiMeo .
His ascension to the top of the crime family greatly aggrieved Corrado " Junior " Soprano , who with his rank and seniority felt he was in line to become boss .
Junior sometimes resented having to take orders from Aprile , who used to fetch Junior sambucas.In 1995 , Junior Soprano fell afoul of Jackie when he hijacked one of his trucks , refusing to acknowledge his position as acting boss .
Junior fled to Boca Raton to avoid retaliation , although later met with Salvatore " Big Pussy " Bonpensiero , agreeing to attend a sit-down so that he and Jackie could resolve their dispute when his safety was guaranteed by his nephew.However , despite leading the DiMeo family through a time of relative peace , Jackie 's reign was short lived .
He was diagnosed with stomach cancer and hospitalized in late 1998 and by early 1999 ( season one ) was clearly fading fast .
Tony started assuming many of Jackie 's responsibilities as a result .
For a brief time in early 1999 , Jackie 's condition improved and he was out on the streets again .
In " 46 Long " Jackie mediated a dispute between Tony and Junior .
However , the cancer had recurred and by " Denial , Anger , Acceptance " he was admitted to hospital and his men often come to pay their respects .
Jackie died of cancer in July 1999 leaving a power vacuum behind within the crime family .
A war between Junior Soprano and Tony Soprano was anticipated , but immediately following Jackie 's death , Tony met with his uncle and Junior became boss .
However , Tony began running the family behind Junior 's back with the support of the other family capos .
This ruse is made easier since Junior had no idea how much money they were kicking up to Jackie .

Ignaz or Ignace Vitzthumb ( also Witzthumb ; 14 September 1724 -- 23 March 1816 ) was an Austrian musician , composer and conductor active in the Austrian Netherlands .
He was also music director of the La Monnaie theatre in Brussels .
Life Vitzthumb was born in Baden bei Wien .
Arriving in Brussels in 1735 at the age of 11 , he entered the service of archduchess Maria Elisabeth of Austria as a child-singer in her choir .
Taught by Jean-Joseph Fiocco , then choirmaster of the Brussels chapel royal , Vitzthumb became a court drummer at sixteen , a post he held for more than 40 years alongside other roles .
His half-brother , François-Antoine Vitzthumb , was a trumpeter in the court and his son Paul Vitzthumb ( 1761 -- 1838 ) succeeded him as court drummer .
After the War of the Austrian Succession , in which he had served in a regiment of Hungarian hussars , he returned to Brussels and took part in several chambers of rhetoric and compagnies bourgeoises , of which there were Francophone as well as Flemish versions .
He showed off his talents as a violinist , conductor and theatre director , and was a member of the Concert bourgeois .
He is also mentioned among the court musicians as a composer , tenor and violinist in 1758 and 1759 , and as a composer from 1760 to 1775 .
From 1761 , he entered the Théâtre de la Monnaie as its composer and music master , and taught singing to young actors such as Angélique D'Hannetaire and Alexandre Bultos .
In 1772 , he and the singer Louis Compain became co-directors of the Théâtre , then Vitzthumb was sole director from 1774 to 1777 .
This period is considered to be one of the most fertile in the Théâtre de la Monnaie 's life , and travellers like Charles Burney did not hesitate to praise the quality of the members of its acting troop and orchestra .
Even so , the theatre soon went bankrupt and so Vitzthumb was forced to abandon his role as director , though he retained that of conductor.Suspended from all his jobs in 1791 for taking part in the insurrection against Joseph II , Vitzthumb left for Amsterdam to take up a post as music master at the " Collège dramatique et lyrique " .
Falling seriously ill the following year , he returned to Brussels to live with his son Paul and died there in 1816 , aged 91 .

Dispase is a protease which cleaves fibronectin , collagen IV , and to a lesser extent collagen I .
It is found in some bacteria and can be isolated from culture filtrates of Bacillus polymyxa .
It can be extracted , purified , and used in research .
It can be particularly useful to separate embryonic epithelia and mesenchyme .
Dispase II is specific for the cleavage of leucine-phenylalanine bonds.Dispase is often used to digest adhering primary cells in culture , since this treatment turned out to be milder than trypsin digestion ( Sinclair et al. , 2013 ) .
A recent article also finds that dispase can digest serine-phenylalanine .
Dispase intravitreal injection can be used in the modeling of proliferative vitreoretinopathy in different animals .

SQEP is an acronym , standing for Suitably Qualified and Experienced Person .
It is usually used to designate : - a professionally qualified person ( such as a Chartered Engineer or Project manager ) who has several years as a practitioner , is registered in their area of expertise within the organisation and sowhose judgement can be used to resolve a technical problem with some finality.This overall route is usually well-documented to satisfy external regulatory authorities that appropriate personnel are in place along the supply chain to undertake critical responsibilities.Although not widely used , the term has gained some currency in the UK Nuclear power industry , see for example this safety management audit report from the Health and Safety Executive .
In the UK nuclear context , it is a standard requirement for licensed sites that " The licensee shall make and implement adequate arrangements to ensure that only suitably qualified and experienced persons perform any duties which may affect the safety of operations on the site or any other duties assigned by or under these conditions or any arrangements required under these conditions . "
.
In this context , the term is not restricted to professionally qualified personnel or to duties requiring significant technical expertise : any means anyIt is essential that all personnel whose activities have the potential to impact on nuclear safety are suitably qualified and experienced ( SQEP ) to carry out their jobs .
This includes both those who directly carry out operations and others such as directors , managers , designers , safety case authors etc whose roles , if inadequately conceived or executed , may affect safety in less visible ways -- for example , through introducing latent technical or organisational weaknesses.and conversely suitably means suitably , not particularly well : the Office of Nuclear Regulation takes SQEPness to be broadly equivalent to the International Atomic Energy Agency concept of ' competence'IAEA has defined competence as “ the ability to put skills and knowledge into practice in order to perform a job in an effective and efficient manner to an established standard ” ONR concurs with this definition , which is widely accepted within the international nuclear community .
Other factors contributing to a person ’s competence include the person ’s prior experience , aptitudes , attitudes , behaviours , skills and qualifications .

Gilbert Clarence Klingel ( 1908 -- 1983 ) was a naturalist , boatbuilder , adventurer , photographer , author , inventor , contributor to the Baltimore Sun , for a time affiliated with the American Museum of Natural History in New York and a member of the Maryland Academy of Sciences , and a curator and charter member of the Natural History Society of Maryland .
He is best known for his book about the Chesapeake Bay , The Bay , which won the John Burroughs Medal in 1953 .
Books and articles Inagua , The Ocean Island , and BASILISK shipwreck Born in 1908 , Klingel built his first boat when he was 20 .
In early 1930 , at Conley 's Boat Yard on Town Creek in Oxford , MD , Klingel supervised the wooden construction of a replica of Spray , the rotund sloop ( eventually rerigged a yawl ) in which Joshua Slocum became the first man to sail solo around the world in 1898 .
Klingel christened his 37 ' yawl BASILISK ( after the common basilisk lizard than can run on the surface of water ) , and with the support of the American Museum of Natural History , it was fitted out as a biological laboratory , to be used for an expedition to gather information on rare species in the West Indies , especially lizards.Klingel had organized an earlier research trip to Haiti to study the life history of reptiles there and had shared his discoveries with the American Museum of Natural History .
With sailing companion W. Wallace Coleman ( 1907-1962 ) , Klingel embarked from Maryland late November 1930 for a planned 18-month voyage to the West Indies .
Battered and exhausted by a gale and unable to determine longitude due to a broken marine chronometer , they miscalculated the current and were shipwrecked on December 10 , 1930 on the island of Inagua , the southernmost and second largest island in the Bahamas .
Although most of his instruments were lost , Klingel decided nonetheless to stay , take pictures with his salvaged cameras , and explore the island.This adventure was published in his first book , Inagua ( also entitled The Ocean Island ) , a memoir of the voyage and a naturalist ’s survey of the island , including detailed pictures of flora and fauna .
It has been translated into Estonian , Swedish , German , and Russian .
This book ( 1940,1942 British ,1944,1954,1957,1961 AMNH paperback ,1997,1999 ) has been out of print , but a new 2010 edition is now available .
The Bay Klingel 's second book , The Bay , illustrated by Natalie Harlan Davis ( 1898-1988 ) , expanded from articles he wrote for the Baltimore Sun , describes the Chesapeake as he 'd known it all the way back to his childhood decades earlier , and includes a detailed naturalist survey of sounds and sights both above and below the surface of the Chesapeake .
In 1953 he was awarded the John Burroughs Medal from the John Burroughs Association for this book ( 1951,1967,1984 ) .
Seeing Chesapeake Wilds Photo-essay about the Chesapeake Bay ’s Eastern Shore , with preface and photographs by Byron Parker Shurtleff ( 1929-1999 ) , a professor of photography at the University of Delaware , and the poetic text by Klingel ( 1970,1973,1977 ) .
Boatbuilding With Steel Klingel ’s final book , Boatbuilding With Steel : Including Boatbuilding With Aluminum , was published in 1973 ( 2nd edition 1991 ) , and is considered a classic on the subject .
The included chapter on aluminum is by noted yacht designer Thomas E. Colvin ( 1925-2014 ) .
Articles Klingel wrote articles for National Geographic and the Baltimore Sun , mainly on topics related to the Chesapeake Bay.His article , " One Hundred Hours Beneath the Chesapeake , " in the May 1955 issue of National Geographic featured color photos by Willard R. Culver ( 1898-1986 ) that were among the first taken from beneath a temperate estuary .
These images were taken from inside a diving vessel invented by Klingel that was lowered into the waters off Gwynn 's Island in the Chesapeake Bay.Klingel also wrote three articles for Natural History - The Journal of the American Museum of Natural History , namely " Lizard Hunting in the Black Republic , " 29 ( 5 ) :450 -464 , " Shipwrecked on Inagua , " 32:42 -55 , and " The Edge of the Edge of the World , " ( 1940 ) 45:68 -73 .
The last recounts a dive with diving helmet on a coral reef and the edge of its 1,200 fathom drop-off , a half mile offshore Inagua.Klingel shot some silent b & w film on his 1928-9 American Museum of Natural History research trip featuring rhinoceros iguanas on La Petite Gonaves , a small coral island off the south coast of Gonave Island , in the Gulf of Gonaves , west-northwest of Port-au-Prince , Haiti .
In August 1932 he co-authored with Gladwyn Kingsley Noble ( 1894-1940 ) the American Museum Novitates number 549 entitled " The Reptiles of Great Inagua Island , British West Indies . "
Klingel found two new species of geckos and one new subspecies of the ameiva maynardi lizard .
Metallurgist , Boatbuilder During World War II , Klingel worked for ARMCO Steel Corporation in Baltimore , where he rose to Chief of Metallurgy in the course of his career there .
In 1947 he built his first steel boat at home in Maryland on weekends , followed by others until he acquired property in 1953 on an island off Virginia 's Middle Peninsula to establish the Gwynn 's Island Boat Yard , where on a part-time basis he built his own workshop and slipway , and boats .
Upon retiring from ARMCO in 1963 he moved to the island permanently.Klingel built about a dozen steel sailboats in the 30 ' class , including Alvin " Al " Mason ( 1911-1995 ) - designed 31 ' sloops FREYA in 1953 and PLEIADES in ?
, plus two Colvin-designed 34 ' Saugeen Witches - ACHATES in 1974 , and Marconi-ketch-rigged INNISFREE in 1975 .
Klingel also built in steel a 42 ' ketch D'VARA in 1969 , a 51 ' staysail schooner PIPISTRELLE in 1972 , a 75 ' C/B 50 ton gaff ketch CLEMENTINE in 1971 , and a 62 ' twin diesel motor yacht MANTEO ( now named MARIAH ) in 1970 .
For retirement gunkholing the Chesapeake , in 1977 Klingel built for himself a 30 ' lateen-rigged steel scow motorsailer , GREEN HERON ( nicknamed CREEK CRAWLER ) , the last boat launched ( 1978 ) from his yard.In addition to these steel boats , Klingel also built the two diving bells ( BENTHARIUM and its successor AQUASCOPE ) that he used for research in the Chesapeake Bay .
BENTHARIUM was a modified steel boiler with sand for ballast .
The AQUASCOPE is on exhibit at the Calvert Marine Museum in Solomons , Maryland.Gilbert C. Klingel died May 16 , 1983 in Virginia at the age of 74 .
There is a permanent exhibit about his life and work at the Gwynn 's Island Museum , Gwynn , Mathews County , Virginia .

Mycetophagus punctatus , sometimes called the hairy fungus beetle , is a species of fungus beetle.Fungus beetles often build heavy populations throughout the late summer and early fall .
These mold-feeding beetles are sometimes found in decaying plant material , damp cereals , grains , herbs , spices , cheese , jam , fibers and carpeting , especially in cellars .
Attracted by lights , these small beetles , can crawl or fly through window or door screens , and then wander aimlessly.Heavy populations of fungus beetles may first show up trapped in bathtubs , sinks or around lamps and TV sets .
They do not bite , sting , spread human diseases nor damage wood , food , fabric , etc. they are just annoying little bugs that will non go away.There are ways to prevent the fungus beetles from coming into your home .
You can make the damp places in your house dry .
these beetles are attracted to wetness .
You can also make sure when you drop food you clean it up so it will not mold and attract the beetles .
Another thing you can do is close all of your dry food in insect-proof containers , this will make it so your food will not mold and attract the beetles.If you already have the beetles and do not know how to get the moisture problems fixed then you could try to use household fungicides , if that does not work then try household aerosol .
When sprayed around windows , lights , doors , baseboards and crevasses it will kill many beetles .

The Cogalnic River ( also Cogâlnic , Kogylnik , Kogîlnic , or Kunduk ) is a 183 km river in Moldova and south-western Ukraine.The Cogalnic rises in the hills of Nisporeni District in the Codri region west of the Moldovan capital , Chişinău .
It flows through the cities of Hînceşti , Cimişlia and Basarabeasca , and then into the Budjak , past Artsyz and into the Prichernomorskoy lowlands of the Odessa Oblast ( province ) of Ukraine .
Together with the Sarata River it enters the Sasyk Liman and thence into the Black Sea .
History Johann Thunmann in his eighteenth century work described it : In warm months , there is a great shortage of water .
Even the largest river in this area , the Kogylnik , then dries , and it is often due to lack of water that the livestock of the Tatars die from thirst .
In the autumn , when the rainy season starts , there appear suddenly appear countless streams across the low country .
All of the marshes are then covered with puddles .
To overcome the water shortages suffered in the summer , one finds very deep wells have been dug everywhere .
Among the Tatars , as in the east , digging wells has become an act of religion and honor .

Mr. Kline and the Wizards of Time was an indie rock band from the Phoenix , Arizona area from 2003-2006 on Uncle Abbott Records .
Band history Mr. Kline started in 2003 by Brandon Abbott and Jesse Mitchell after the breakup of The Hot Guy Band , the previous brainchild of Joe Ging and Brandon Abbott .
After Hellogoodbye frontman , Forrest Kline , offered his last name to use for the band , the previously unnamed project became a band.The band incorporated a new mix of drum machines simultaneously with live drums , keyboards and guitars into catchy , up-beat pop songs .
Having written a few songs , the band quickly recorded with friend and producer , [ Bob Hoag ] , who offered to join the band as its third member .
Soon after recording a four-song EP consisting of " The Hungry Ghost " , " The Antebellum " , " The Education of Girl Town " , and " The Music Heard and the Defeat/Victory at the Battle for Mars " .
Soon after recording the EP , the band added members , Michael Porter and Andy Hiller .
Mr Kline would play a handful of shows as a four-piece , as it was usually not the case that all five members would be present for any particular show , because of commitments to their other bands.Jesse Mitchell left the band in 2004 and was replaced briefly by Jake Wiedmann and then Chad Staples .
Ryan Lower joined the band in 2005 first as art director , for designing all of the art the band used for any merchandise and its album , and then as a member of the band.In 2005-2006 , Mr. Kline gradually worked on its only full-length album for [ Uncle Abbott Records ] aptly titled , " [ This Albums Cursed or These Soft Pipes , Play On ] " .
Having been convinced the album was in deed cursed , due to its incredibly torturous experience because of extenuating circumstances beyond the band 's control , it was named so .
However , nearing the end of recording the album , a very pleasing product was accompanied by the fact that member and producer , Bob Hoag , had learned he would be a father .
This was explained on the back of the album .
Thus , the band opted to add the alternative album title , " These Soft Pipes , Play On " , along with alternative song titles.Shortly after releasing the album and having gotten closure on the experience , the band dismantled in order to focus on other passions .
Members , Michael Porter and Andy Hiller formed The Wizards of Time , while Bob Hoag focused on producing and his other bands , and other members pursued academia .
In July 2007 , members Brandon Abbott , Bob Hoag , and Ryan Lower recorded a four-song EP under the moniker , Gentlemen .
Members None of the members of Mr. Kline and the Wizards of Time were credited as having played any particular instrument .
Their roles constantly overlapped as the needs of the band changed per song.Brandon AbbottJesse MitchellBob HoagMichael PorterAndy HillerRyan LowerChad StaplesJake Wiedmann Discography Mr. Kline produced 4 EPs , recorded at various studios , which it circulated at shows and on the internet prior to releasing its album .2003 - EP - " The Hungry Ghost EP " 2004 - EP - " Tribute to Duplow EP " 2005 - EP - " Airplanes and Butterknives EP " 2005 - EP - " Oh Tokyo EP " 2005 - LP - " This Albums Cursed or These Soft Pipes , Play On "
While the United States was involved in the prosecution of war criminals , US military and intelligence agencies protected some war criminals in the interest of obtaining technical or intelligence information from them , or taking part in ongoing intelligence or engineering ( e.g. , Operation Paperclip ) .
The relationships with German war criminals started immediately after the end of the Second World War , but some of the Japanese relationships were slower to develop.The concealment was not always deliberate , as some records were scattered among a huge volume of government records .
In some cases , prosecutors actively developed cases against individuals , yet were unaware the US had detailed records on them .
The US Congress instituted an interagency working group ( IWG ) , under the auspices of the National Archives and Records Administration to investigate the issue .
Many of these relationships were formed by the Counter-Intelligence Corps ( CIC ) before the creation of the CIA in 1947 .
In some cases , the CIA took over the relationships and concealed them for nearly 60 years .
Containment and anticommunism Several doctrines affected the postwar policy under which these relationships were formed , although not all historians agree that all applied .
Containment , general anti-Communism , and so called McCarthyism were generally accepted.Containment , as a concept in US foreign policy after World War II , was intellectually given support by George F. Kennan , first in an internal document called " the long telegram " and then the " X article " in Foreign Affairs , " The Sources of Soviet Conduct " published under the pseudonym " X " .
While Kennan advocated a nuanced implementation of limiting Soviet options , US policy became increasingly absolutist : that which was bad for communism was good , and preventing modifications of democratic capitalism was considered important enough to justify co-work with war criminals.The actions of Senator Joe McCarthy , however , were more reflexively anti-communist .
The mere accusation of communism was often sufficient grounds to act against individuals or organizations .
Searching for order or opportunities ?
According to Kisatsky , Byroade 's comment , " Only by “ [ convincing ] the Germans that they are equals ” could the United States “ retain ... power ” and achieve its global objectives . "
showed that U.S.-German policy , in a broader policy of Atlantic politics , had multiple dimensions and multiple time periods .
A subtle but important point is not that the US was concerned both with right-wing nationalism , which might or might not be a Nazi resurgence , and Communism.During the occupation , " American leaders during the Allied occupation ( 1945 -- 55 ) worked to transform the former Nazi dictatorship into a reliable partner of the West .
Denazification and related programs helped expunge totalitarian practices and promote democratic governance.West German economic and military integration with Europe ( 1955-1990 ) minimized risk of a third World War by enhancing mutual interdependence among the major continental states .
Nationalism potentially undermined American goals .
Growing resentment of Germany ’s occupation and division roused competitive national urges inimical to peace .
Allied leaders could best ensure the Federal Republic ’s allegiance to the West by granting full autonomy and by treating West Germans as equals.After German reunification in 1990 , cooperative Allied-German relations facilitated progress and enabled the United States to “ retain power ” in Europe.Within the US government , and by its critics , is a constant debate between absolute morality and the perceived needs of realpolitik with respect to communists and allies . "
Elizabeth Holtzman , a former US Congresswoman from New York and member of the panel , the Nazi War Crimes and Japanese Imperial Government Records Interagency Working Group , said the documents showed that the CIA " failed to lift a finger " to hunt Eichmann and " force us to confront not only the moral harm but the practical harm " of relying on intelligence from ex-Nazis .
According to Holtzman , information from the former Nazis was often tainted both by their " personal agendas " and their vulnerability to blackmail . "
Using bad people can have very bad consequences , " Holtzman said .
She and other group members suggested that the findings should be a cautionary tale for intelligence agencies today . "
Evaluating the intelligence process Naftali and others have suggested that a useful , if amoral choice , is to consider whether the results of the use of tainted resources produced good results , saying " it 's healthy for a society to have the tools to evaluate the performance of its intelligence community -- even if the performance involves activities that are 50 years old .
And I would also hope that the intelligence community itself will take lessons from the past . "
Hans-Georg Wieck , head of the German BND intelligence organization between 1985 and 1990 , commented that " with the disclosure of documents on the U.S. Army 's and the CIA 's relationships with Gehlen , the downside of that cooperation has become known .
The upside-the quality of the intelligence project-remains undisclosed .
Hence even with righteous , detached hindsight , a cost-benefit analysis of hiring Gehlen and his people remains far more difficult to make , even today , than Naftali thinks .
He concedes that contacts with unsavory characters sometimes prove beneficial .
This was the case with Gehlen 's organization . "
European Policy Gehlen Organization Much of the immediate postwar activity , until the mid-fifties when it became part of West Germany 's BND intelligence agency , was the Gehlen Organization .
Reinhard Gehlen approached US Army intelligence shortly after the end of the war , and offered his files and staff on the Eastern Front and Soviet Union .
Gehlen himself was not considered to be a war criminal , but some of his staff may have been.Gehlen originally had an excellent reputation in intelligence , but recent information has brought this into question .
At the GHI symposium , Michael Wala , managing editor of the German publication , Journal of Intelligence History , said Gehlen was assumed to have transformed German intelligence during the war .
Wala , however , said it was less that Gehlen was so good as a Soviet analyst , but that his predecessors , prior to his taking over the Fremde Heere Ost ( FHO , English " Foreign Armies East " ) had been so bad .
Prior to 1942 , Nazi racism caused FHO to deprecate Soviet strength and equipment , such as the T-34 , widely believed to be the best tank of the Second World War .
Even though Gehlen was not able to keep Nazi ideology out of estimates , leading to such things as a failure to predict the Soviet resistance at Stalingrad , he remained highly regarded by the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht ( OKW , English : High Command of the Armed Forces ) .
Timothy Naftali devalues the early postwar cooperation between the CIA and what became West Germany 's BND .
According to Naftali , Gehlen 's organization and its successor , the BND , was of " questionable " value and that " CIA records show that Gehlen was insubordinate , his organization was insecure , and the entire operation provided intelligence of questionable value .
Fifty years later , the German government still refuses to declassify its own records on the subject .
Until it does , and unless those documents paint a dramatically new picture of the situation , the account of the Gehlen organization in the early Cold War will remain damning . "
According to Wieck , the Gehlen Organization may have recruited up to 100 former SS men who may have been guilty of war crimes .
Critchfield , the US liaison with Gehlen from 1948 to 1956 , " had in mind a good greater than intelligence collection : assuring that the security elite of the new German state would be firmly Atlanticist .
This contributed in no small way both to the development of mutual trust between the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States and to the preclusion of a domestic neofascist or nationalist threat to the former . "
Schmitz , a member of Critchfield 's staff from 1949 to 1954 , and his deputy in 1953 and 1954 , said " the implication is that these former SS personnel-indeed , all former SS personnel-were unexposed war criminals and , as such , were subject to blackmail by the Soviets . "
Planning Stay-Behind Networks Alongside the Gehlen Organisation , CIC had set up stay-behind networks in West Germany , who were supposed to stay put in the event of a Soviet invasion and transmit intelligence from behind enemy lines , some of which included ex-Nazis .
Most of the networks were dismantled in the early 1950s .
One example was an apparent equivalent to the East German Freie Deutsche Jugend ( Free German Youth ) , the Bund Deutscher Jugend ( BDJ , League of German Youth ) seemed , at first , to be a youth group that countered Communist movements .
Its increasing militancy and secretiveness about its financing , however , brought it to the attention of Georg August Zinn , the Socialist Minister President of Hesse .
Zinn discovered that BDJ was US-funded , and inside BDJ was a covert operations service , Technischer Dienst ( " Technical Service " ) made up of former German officers , some Nazis and SS men , between 35 and 50 years old .
Their mission was to wage guerilla warfare against a Soviet invasion . "
The BDJ affair demonstrated that at least some agencies of the U.S. government willingly worked with undemocratic elements in service to American power . "
After Zinn 's presentation , the US High Commissioner for Germany ( HICOG ) , Walter J. Donnelly , asked the West German government and Socialist Party to join in a U.S.-German investigation of the whole affair : " Let 's get to the bottom of this .
Let the chips fall where they may . "
Donelley and the United States Department of State were correct in that senior HICOG personnel had refused to meet with BDJ .
John J. McCloy , the previous HICOG , refused to meet with BDJ , but US intelligence organized BDJ after becoming concerned by the invasion of Korea .
US intelligence seemed to have been unaware of the BDJ blacklist and tried , too late , to denounce it and avoid Soviet propaganda .
The Communists , however , termed it a proof of US-Nazi conspiracy .
CIA name file analysis A CIA document , dated 19 March 1958 , from the Munich station chief to headquarters , stated that German intelligence had provided a list of former Nazis and their locations .
Eichmann was third on the list .
The memo passed on a rumour that he was in Jerusalem " despite the fact that he was responsible for mass extermination of Jews " , but also states , matter-of-factly : " He is reported to have lived in Argentina under the alias Clemens since 1952 . "
There is no record of a follow-up in the CIA to this tip-off .
When Eichmann was captured the CIA combed files it had captured from the Nazis to find information that might be useful to the Israeli prosecution .
The results caused near panic among the CIA 's leadership because , unknown to the junior staff who had looked through the files , a few of Eichmann 's accomplices being investigated had been CIA " assets " , and who might be discovered through Soviet knowledge of the Israeli prosecution records .
Heinz Felfe The recruitment of Heinz Felfe , an SS officer who rose through the ranks of West Germany ’s Gehlen organization to become its counterintelligence chief in 1955 did not only raise questions of ethics , but produced a major security failure .
In 1961 , Felfe was identified as a Soviet spy who was very familiar with CIA operations in Eastern Europe , which put him in position to sabotage a CIA operations against the KGB base in East Germany .
The CIA subsequently estimated that Felfe had compromised 15,000 items Handling Nazis outside Germany Erhard Dabringhaus , a U.S. Army ( CIC ) intelligence officer in post-war Germany from 1946 to 1952 ( i.e. , the year that the OPC clandestine service was brought under CIA control ) , and later a language professor at Detroit 's Wayne State University , was Klaus Barbie 's case officer .
Dabringhaus said he was ordered to house and pay Barbie , and did inform his command of Barbie 's past actions .
In 1951 , Barbie turned up in Genoa , Italy , before escaping to Bolivia with documents issued by the International Committee of the Red Cross.According to Bill Moyers , Barbie worked with ex-Nazi Germans reporting on the Soviets .
Once his work was done , the US did not turn him over to the French , but helped him escape , via Italy , to Bolivia .
An analysis of Barbie 's U.S. Army file , by the IWG , recounted that in May 1949 , the French Ministry of Interior pressed the U.S. military government of Germany , HICOG , for Barbie 's extradition .
The CIC , however , was concerned both that Barbie knew too much about CIC espionage networks , but also about the adverse publicity if it became known he had been recruited .
From the HICOG file , To have exposed BARBIE to interrogation and public trial would not have been in consonance with accepted clandestine intelligence operational doctrine ... [ H ] e was knowledgeable of high level operations and operational procedures , which would have been compromised .
Through procedures in effect at that time , BARBIE was therefor [ sic ] assisted in 1951 in leaving Europe for resettlement .
U.S. Army Intelligence has had no further contact with BARBIE subsequent to his departure from Europe.CIC arranged for Barbie to reach South America through Italy .
Barbie , using an alias but otherwise living openly in Bolivia , was extradited to France in 1983 .
While in Bolivia , he was also a security advisor to Alfredo Stroessner , President of Paraguay from 1954 to 1989 .
The United States Attorney General ordered the Office of Special Investigations of the United States Department of Justice to produce an investigative report .
Alan Ryan , outgoing head of OSI , detailed the use by U.S. intelligence of Barbie , including his escape using a line that included assistance from a Croatian priest in the Vatican .
Ryan concluded that " no other case was found where a suspected Nazi war criminal was placed in the rat line , or where the rat line was used to evacuate a person wanted ... " But , he did find , " that officers of the CIC engaged in obstruction of justice ... although " prosecution is moot because of the statute of limitations " ) Weitzman referred to a 22 May 1999 report , in The Times , which painted a much larger scope .
It cited Dabringhaus as personally having recruited hundreds of Nazis , operating at least into the 1960s .
Some SS men may have worked for the CIA in Latin America , and may have taught methods of torture .
Pacific Policy General Douglas MacArthur essentially banned the OSS from his South West Pacific Area ( SWPA ) , while OSS simply was less relevant to the naval and " island hopping " operations in Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz 's Pacific Ocean Area theater .
Since there was no postwar alliance to be preserved for US intelligence , there were few reasons to keep matters classified due to the sensitivities of a key ally .
While the US did work with Australia and New Zealand , MacArthur had essentially subordinated their commands.The number and types of Japanese who formed relationships with U.S. intelligence differ from their Nazi counterparts .
The Japanese were fewer in number than the Germans who were directly to collect HUMINT from the Soviets or take part in stay-behind networks after invasion .
Some of the Japanese were imprisoned for investigation , or actually served prison time for war crimes , perhaps being released early .
Far more of the Japanese were later at a much higher level of authority than were the Germans .
U.S. intelligence conflict in postwar Japan Until his relief , MacArthur used his own intelligence organization , G-2 , headed by Major General Charles A. Willoughby , a confidante of MacArthur .
Immediately after the war , Japanese ex-officers and nationalists created an informal network intended to preserve , as far as possible , the Imperial system and eventually to re-establish the military.Most US contacts with the underground groups were combat rather than intelligence specialists .
Most of the links established by U.S. authorities to the Japanese underground groups , were to high ranking officers with operational and combat experience .
Another significant intelligence specialist , with an extensive network of contacts among officers , was Lieutenant General Kawabe Torashiro .
Kawabe joined with Arisue in providing the services of former Japanese Army personnel to occupation authorities , particularly G-2 .
Kawabe ’s last headquarters assignment gave him informal authority over many groups and individuals within the army .
His network was made up primarily of former high-ranking army general staff members and their subordinates .
These individuals were in networks of subordinate organizations , called kikan , that would carry out actual operations.In one important case , that of Ishii Shiro , the intelligence cooperation was not for shaping the political destiny of postwar Japan or for obtaining future intelligence , but as a trade of immunity for technical data .
Japanese who worked with US intelligence A variety of relationships existed , first with G-2 and then with the CIA .
Characteristic of the G-2 relationships was a significant amount of delegation of both planning and execution to Japanese , since SCAP did not itself have the manpower for detailed monitoring , nor would it work with CIA in the theater or in the US.After his rehabilitation in 1950 , Masanobu Tsuji received U.S. finding through the G-2 ’s Historical Branch under Willoughby .
Through Arisue , G-2 recruited and employed some 200 former Japanese officers to assist historian Gordon Prange ’s work on the history of MacArthur ’s Pacific campaign .
A central figure in this effort was Colonel Hattori Takushiro .
One of the most important members of the Hattori kikan , known in some CIA documents as “ Willoughby ’s Stable , ” was Hattori ’s close friend Tsuji Masanobu.The key individual in the " undergrounds " was Lieutenant General Arisue Seizo , chief of the intelligence department at Imperial General Headquarters at the end of the war .
Shortly before the end of the war , Arisue began collecting intelligence documents to use as a bargaining chip with the Occupation .
SCAP sentiment toward Arisue was mixed , and officers outside G-2 considered indicting Arisue as a Class A war criminal .
Willoughby , however , had met and liked Lieutenant General Kawabe Torashiro who had been head of intelligence for the Kwantung Army , military attaché to Berlin , deputy chief of staff for Imperial GHQ , and the leader of the surrender delegation to Manila.Willoughby asked Arisue , in September 1945 , to set up a domestic intelligence network to warn of a potential Communist coup .
Willoughby was unaware that Arisue and some of his associates , at various times , considered right-wing coups against the Japanese government.Other prominent individuals who worked with US intelligence include Shiro Ishii , Kaya Okinori , Kodama Yoshio , Tsuji Matsunobui , Takushiro Hattori and Ryuzo Sejima .

In parliamentary procedure , a motion for division of a question is used to separate a motion into a set of motions .
History The concept of a division of a question dates back to at least 1640 , when the Lex Parliamentaria noted , " If a Question upon a Debate contains more Parts than one , and Members seem to be for one Part , and not for the other ; it may be moved , that the same may be divided into two , or more Questions : as Dec. 2 , 1640 , the Debate about the Election of two Knights was divided into two Questions . "
Explanation and Use A motion for division of a question is used to split a motion into separate motions which are debated and voted on separately.According to Robert 's Rules of Order Newly Revised ( RONR ) , this motion is applicable when each of the different parts , although relating to a single subject , is capable of standing as a complete proposition without the others .
The motion is made by saying , for instance , " I move to divide the resolution so as to consider separately ... " A motion to divide the question is not required when a single motion seeks approval of a series of propositions or resolutions on different subjects .
Any member may obtain separate discussion and voting on any of the unrelated propositions or resolutions by making a demand for separate consideration , at any time before the unified motion is put to a vote .
Parliament In the British House of Commons , a formal motion is not required to divide the question ; since 1888 , the Speaker has held that a question consisting of two or more propositions , each of which is able to stand on its own , can be divided on the objection of any Member of Parliament .
Related motions Consideration by paragraph , consider by parts , or consider seriatim are names for a similar motion whereby a complex motion is broken up to be deliberated part by part .
Each part is considered tentatively and amended as necessary , then the whole motion is considered and voted on as a whole .
This differs from the motion to divide a question which splits the motion into two or more independent motions that are taken up in sequence .
Each new motion is deliberated and voted upon before taking up the next part.Division of the question is not to be confused with division of the assembly , which is a call for a rising vote .

The Cray APP ( Attached Parallel Processor ) was a parallel computer sold by Cray Research from 1992 onwards .
It was based on the Intel i860 microprocessor and could be configured with up to 84 processors .
The design was based on " computational nodes " of 12 processors interconnected by a shared bus , with multiple nodes connected to each other , memory and I/O nodes via an 8 × 8 crossbar switch.The APP was marketed as a " matrix co-processor " system and required a SPARC-based host system to operate , such as the Cray S-MP .
Connection to the host system was via VMEbus or HiPPI .
A fully configured APP had a peak performance of 6.7 ( single-precision ) gigaflops.The APP was originally designed by FPS Computing as the FPS MCP-784 .
FPS were acquired by Cray Research in 1991 , becoming Cray Research Superservers Inc. , and the MCP-784 was relaunched by Cray in 1992 as the APP .

TCDD DE18000 are a type of diesel-electric locomotive built for operations on Turkish State Railways by Matériel de Traction Electrique .
The order was a trial for a ligher version of the DE24000 , and only five units were delivered .
The units were mostly used around Izmir and are now retired .
History During the 1970s the Turkish State Railways decided to replace their 800 steam locomotives with diesel .
This quite delayed task required the delivery of more than 400 diesel units .
On February 15 , 1968 TCDD and MTE signed an agreement for delivery of the DE24000 and the DE18000 .
TCDD opted for the larger Co'Co ' engine , and only five were delivered of the smaller Bo'Bo ' .

The 2008 United States presidential election in Missouri was held on November 4 , 2008 , and was part of the 2008 United States presidential election , which took place throughout all 50 states and D.C. .
Voters chose 11 representatives , or electors to the Electoral College , who voted for President and Vice President.Missouri was won by Republican nominee John McCain by just shy of 4,000 votes , a 0.1 % margin of victory .
Prior to the election , most news organizations considered this state a toss-up , or a swing state .
On election day , Missouri was the closest state in 2008 , with some news organizations not calling the state until two weeks after the election .
A high turnout of voters in the GOP strongholds of Greene County ( Springfield ) and St. Charles County combined with Democrat Barack Obama 's lackluster performance in the more rural parts of the state gave the edge to Republican John McCain .
McCain nipped Obama by fewer than 4,000 votes and the margin of victory was a minuscule difference of 0.13 % .
The state was so close that Obama could have legally called for a recount , but since he had already won the presidency , he saw no need to do so as the results would have been meaningless in the national totals .
It was the first time since 1956 , and only the second time since 1900 , that Missouri did not vote for the winner of the presidency .
The same of which would also occur four years later when Mitt Romney won the state over Obama , but did not win the overall election .
This would be the last time when Missouri was seriously contested , and considered to be a swing/bellwether state , while moving deeper & safer into the Republican side four years later onward .
This is also the last time that Iron County , Jefferson County , Washington County , Ste. Genevieve County , and Buchanan County voted for the Democratic candidate .
Primaries Missouri Democratic primary , 2008Missouri Republican primary , 2008 Campaign With the advent of the September financial crisis , Obama began to look viable .
John McCain 's lead diminished and then disappeared ; for several weeks Obama even led Missouri polls .
Obama started visiting Republican-leaning states , including Missouri .
In one of the more memorable trips of the campaign , he drew crowds of 75,000 at Kansas City and 100,000 at St. Louis .
However , John McCain 's campaign managed to close the gap and most polls showed a dead tie on and before Election Day.Although seven of Missouri 's eight neighboring states offered the option of early voting , the option was not available in Missouri .
Election results must go through a certification process before they are official ; local election officials had until November 18 to verify their results and process the provisional ballots cast throughout Missouri .
Predictions There were 17 news organizations who made state by state predictions of the election .
Here are their last predictions before election day :D .

In the fall campaign , polls were back and forth with both .
In the last few weeks when Obama was having the momentum , the final 5 polls taken in the state were all a tie.Here are the final polls in the state : Fundraising John McCain raised a total of $ 2,904,162 in the state .
Barack Obama raised $ 4,999,812 .
Advertising and visits Obama and his interest groups spent $ 11,323,706 .
McCain and his interest groups spent $ 9,428,559 .
The Democratic ticket visited the state 13 times throughout the general election .
The Republican ticket visited here 14 times.McCain 's Visits : June 18 : SpringfieldJuly 15 : St. LouisJuly 17 : Kansas CityJuly 30 : Kansas CityAugust 31 : St. LouisOctober 8 : Vice Presidential nominee Sarah Palin campaigned in Cape Girardeau at the Show-Me Center on the campus of Southeast Missouri State University in an effort to reach out to the base of the GOP.Obama 's Visits : May 13 : During the course of the ongoing Democratic Presidential Primary , Obama visited Thorngate factory in Cape Girardeau in Southeast Missouri alongside U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill to speak to a group of factory workers .
These blue-collar , working-class whites were a voting bloc that strongly backed Hillary Clinton throughout the primary.June 9 -- 10 : St. LouisJune 30 : IndependenceJuly 5 : St. LouisJuly 7 : St. Louis ( unscheduled ; plane maintenance ) July 30 : Springfield , Rolla , UnionAugust 25 , 26 : Kansas CityOctober 18 : St. LouisOctober 30 : ColumbiaNovember 1 : Springfield Analysis For the better part of a century , Missouri has been reckoned as the nation 's bellwether state .
Prior to 2008 , since 1904 , Missouri had voted for the winner in every presidential election except in 1956 when the state narrowly voted for Democrat Adlai Stevenson of neighboring Illinois over incumbent Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower .
In recent years , however , it has gradually been trending Republican .
Although Bill Clinton of neighboring Arkansas won the state with ease during both of his elections in 1992 and 1996 , Al Gore and John Kerry considered the Show-Me State a lost cause and did not campaign much there .
Although Barack Obama is from neighboring Illinois , at first he likewise put the state as a secondary concern in relation to other swing states such as Ohio and Virginia where he thought he had more of a chance .
As his lead diminished in the summer months , he and McCain moved the campaign to more Democratic-friendly states , as McCain maintained a comfortable polling lead in Missouri .
Similar hypothetical general match-up polls taken between McCain and Hillary Rodham Clinton , however , showed Clinton always leading in Missouri.A record 2.9 million Missourians , or 69 % of eligible voters , cast their ballots in the general election , about 200,000 more than the previous record in the 2004 election.On Election Day , John McCain clung to a tiny lead , with absentee and provisional ballots yet to be counted .
By Wednesday , November 19 , McCain led President-elect Obama by 1,445,813 -- 1,441,910 votes , or approximately 0.14 % of the total popular vote in Missouri .
CNN called the state for McCain that day .
The 2008 presidential election was only the second time in 104 years that it had not voted for the winner of the general election .
Missouri was , however , the closest state of the 2008 election.The Democratic base of Missouri rests in its two largest cities in the west and east -- Kansas City and St. Louis , respectively .
Obama did extremely well here , winning 83.55 % of the vote in St. Louis City and 78.4 % in Kansas City .
Obama was already a familiar face to St. Louis-area voters , since the St. Louis metro area spills into Illinois .
McCain narrowly won the areas in Jackson County outside Kansas City with 49.9 % to Obama 's 48.8 % , but Obama carried the county with 62.14 % of the vote due to his strong performance in Kansas City .
These two counties , combined with highly affluent and suburban St. Louis County ( where he also won 59.50 % of the vote ) , gave him a 300,000 margin over McCain .
Obama was also able to carry Boone County , home to the large college town of Columbia ( Missouri 's fifth-largest city and home of the state 's flagship University of Missouri campus ) , and Jefferson County , which consists of the southern St. Louis suburbs such as Arnold and Festus .
George W. Bush narrowly won Jefferson County in 2004 over John Kerry.However , Obama was unable to substantially improve on Kerry 's performance in rural Missouri , which is largely responsible for Missouri 's Republican tilt .
During the 2008 Missouri Democratic Primary , every rural county in Missouri ( with the exception of Nodaway County , home of Northwest Missouri State University in Maryville in Northwestern Missouri ) , strongly backed Hillary Clinton , often by more than two-to-one margins .
Many , if not all , of these counties that Clinton won in the Missouri Primary ended up voting for McCain in the general election .
A number of these counties are ancestrally Democratic .
However , these counties are very similar in character to Yellow Dog Democrat areas in neighboring Tennessee , Arkansas and Oklahoma .
The Democrats in these areas are nowhere near as liberal as their counterparts in St. Louis and Kansas City , and much like their counterparts in neighboring Tennessee and Arkansas , had become increasingly willing to support Republicans at the national level.Obama lost by an almost two-to-one margin in Southwest Missouri , a Republican stronghold for the better part of a century .
This region is entrenched in the Bible Belt and embedded with deep pockets of social conservatives that includes Springfield and Joplin .
Even Bill Clinton could not win Southwest Missouri in 1992 despite the fact that he won the state by double digits .
Rural Northern Missouri voted against Obama by a three-to-two margin ; this region warmly supported Bill Clinton in both of his bids .
Obama also lost much of rural Southeast Missouri .
Unlike Northern and Southwest Missouri , Southeast Missouri , which strongly backed Bill Clinton both times , is more Democratic at the local and state levels .
The region takes in the Lead Belt , the Bootheel and the Ozark Plateau and includes the largest city of Cape Girardeau , a booming college town but also a conservative , upper-middle class community that votes overwhelmingly Republican .
Southeast Missouri is socially conservative but economically liberal , consistently electing Democrats at the local and state levels .
While Obama ran even in the area southwest of St. Louis , he did worse than John Kerry in the Bootheel .
Obama was , however , able to pick up two counties in Southeast Missouri : Washington County ( by a margin of five votes ) and Iron County .
Both counties are predominantly rural and White but are some of the most impoverished counties in the state that are controlled by Democrats at the local and state levels .
Both counties gave Hillary Clinton over 70 % of the vote in the Missouri Primary as well.Obama was allowed to request a recount under state law since preliminary results showed a difference of less than 1 % of the votes .
The request would have had to be granted by the state .
However , since Obama already won the election , there had been no indications to suggest that he would request a recount .
He ultimately did not request one.The was the first Presidential election that a Democrat won without winning the state of Missouri , a feat Obama would repeat in 2012 .
During the same election , Democratic Attorney General Jay Nixon defeated U.S. Representative Kenny Hulshof in a landslide for the Governor 's Mansion .
Incumbent Republican Governor Matt Blunt did not seek a second term .
Nixon performed extremely well in rural Missouri and clinched 58.40 % of the total statewide vote compared to Hulshof 's 39.49 % to become Governor of Missouri .
Republicans were , however , able to hold on to the U.S. House seat in Missouri 's 9th Congressional District that was vacated by Hulshof in his unsuccessful gubernatorial bid .
Republican Blaine Luetkemeyer narrowly defeated Democrat Judy Baker by less than 3 percentage points , in large part due to McCain winning it by 11 points .
At the state level , Democrats picked up three seats in the Missouri House of Representatives but Republicans expanded their majority in the Missouri Senate , picking up three seats here .
Furthermore , upon the 2008 election , Democrats control all statewide offices but one -- Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder is a Republican .
Democrats held on to the office of Attorney General that was vacated by Governor Jay Nixon ; Democrat Chris Koster defeated Republican Mike Gibbons 52.83 % to 47.17 % .
Democrats also picked up the office of State Treasurer that was vacated by Republican Sarah Steelman in her unsuccessful bid for the GOP gubernatorial nomination .
Democrat Clint Zweifel defeated Republican Brad Lager 50.47 % to 47.14 % .
Results Results breakdown By county By congressional district John McCain carried six of the state ’s nine congressional districts , including one district held by a Democrat .
Electors Technically the voters of Missouri cast their ballots for electors : representatives to the Electoral College .
Missouri is allocated 11 electors because it has nine congressional districts and two senators .
All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of 11 electors , who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate .
Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded all 11 electoral votes .
Their chosen electors then vote for President and Vice President .
Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate , they are not obligated to vote for them .
An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector.The electors of each state and the District of Columbia met on December 15 , 2008 to cast their votes for President and Vice President .
The Electoral College itself never meets as one body .
Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols.The following were the members of the Electoral College from the state .

Cinq-Mars , subtitled ( Une conjuration sous Louis XIII ) , is an opera in four acts by Charles Gounod to a libretto by Paul Poirson and Louis Gallet loosely adapted from Alfred de Vigny 's historical novel .
Performance history Cinq-Mars was initially performed at the Opéra-Comique on April 5 , 1877 .
The work 's reception was lukewarm : " If [ it ] adds nothing to the glory of Gounod , neither does it diminish it . "
Some critics seized on the straddling of the genres of grand opéra and opéra comique ; a second edition ( Léon Grus , n.d. ) contains recitatives for the very few spoken scenes as well as an Act III cantabile for de Thou , written for the La Scala production .
Roles Synopsis The plot faithfully follows the external events of the failed revolt of the French nobility against Richelieu 's consolidation of power , but adds a secret love affair between the Marquis of Cinq-Mars and a princess .
Whereas de Vigny 's character yearned to become her social equal , the opera 's hero enters politics only on learning of a planned marriage between Marie and the king of Poland .
After the conspiracy is discovered , she is given a chance to save him by agreeing to the match , but her sacrifice is in vain : before their escape plans can be put into effect , the hour of execution is suddenly moved forward .
Act 1 The castle of the marquis de Cinq-MarsA choir of noblemen celebrates the imminent importance Cinq-Mars is going to take ( " A la Cour vous allez paraître " ) ; some suggest that he owes his debt of allegiance to the Cardinal of Richelieu , and others to the King .
For his part , Cinq-Mars shows himself indifferent to the questions of political order .
Alone with his closest friend , de Thou , he confesses that he loves princess Marie de Gonzague ( " Henri !
Vous nous parliez " ) .
They recognize both intuitively that this affair will end badly .
The guests reappear : among them is Father Joseph , the spokesman for the Cardinal of Richelieu , and the Princess Marie .
The first one announces that Cinq-Mars is called to the royal court , and that a marriage is arranged between Princess Marie and the King of Poland .
Cinq-Mars and Marie agree to meet later in the evening .
After the departure of the guests , Marie wishes her heart to be at peace in the sweetness of the night ( " Nuit resplendissante " ) .
Cinq-Mars walks in and declares his love to her ; before he leaves , she declares herself in turn ( " Ah !
Vous m ' avez pardonné ma folie " ) .
Act 2 Scene 1 : The King 's apartmentsAfter a choir sings the beauty of courtesan Marion Delorme ( " A Marion , reine des belles " ) , Fontrailles , Montrésor , Montmort , de Brienne , Monglat , and the other courtesans discuss the increasing influence of Cinq-Mars over the King .
The nobles are dissatisfied with the excessive power that the Cardinal of Richelieu has assumed , and they wonder if Cinq-Mars will join finally their cause .
Marion reports that the Cardinal threatens to exile Cinq-Mars ; Fontrailles is surprised , and is sure that Paris would become very boring without its elegant salons ( " On ne verra plus dans Paris " ) .
Marion announces that she will organize a ball the next day , which will give them the opportunity to cast the basis of an intrigue to eliminate the Cardinal .
Cinq-Mars appears and is welcomed by the courtesans ( " Ah !
Monsieur le Grand Ecuyer " ) .
Marie has just arrived at the Court , and the two lovers are reunited ( " Quand vous m ' avez dit un jour " ) .
However , just after this blessed moment , Father Joseph comes to announce that , in spite of the King 's informal agreement of Cinq-Mars 's marriage with Marie , the Cardinal refuses to formalize their union , preferring rather to follow the original plan of marrying Marie to the King of Poland.Scene 2 : At Marion Delorme 's apartmentsThe evening begins with the reading of Madeleine de Scudéry 's last novel , Clélie , followed by a long pastoral entertainment with ballet , including notably a sonnet sung by a shepherd ( " De vos traits mon âme est navrée " ) .
More serious things are on everyone 's mind , however ( " Viendra-t-il ? " )
.
Fontrailles assures everyone that Cinq-Mars will join the plot , as he predicted , and that Cinq-Mars will arrive soon .
He declares that the King is no longer in total control of the country , and that the eviction of the Cardinal is a just cause ; civil war is imminent , and he assures his co-conspirators that he arranged a treaty with Spain , which implies that their armies will intervene on their side .
De Thou suddenly interrupts him , and warns him against opening France up to a foreign power , but the marquis remains resolute .
Act 3 The next day .
Outside of a chapelA meeting of the conspirators is imminent .
Marie appears , contrary to all expectations , and agrees with Cinq-Mars to immediately exchange wedding vows ( " Madame , c'est le lieu du rendez-vous " ) .
After their departure , Father Joseph and Eustache appear from a hiding place : Eustache is a spy and makes a complete report of the intrigue to Father Joseph .
Father Joseph savors the power which he possesses on the fate of Cinq-Mars ( " Tu t ' en vas " ) .
He confronts Marie with the announcement of the execution of Cinq-Mars , for betraying the country by dealing independently with a foreign power .
Further , he tells her , the Polish ambassador will return soon from a hunt with the King , and Father Joseph advises Marie to answer him favorably ; in exchange , Cinq-Mars will be spared .
When the royal suite arrives , Marie capitulates ( " Hallali !
Chasse superbe " ) .
Act 4 A prisonAs he waits for execution , Cinq-Mars regrets that Marie abandoned him ; nevertheless , his last hour approaching , he evokes her image by way of consolation ( " O chère et vivante image " ) .
Marie enters , explains the guile of Father Joseph , and admits that she always loved Cinq-Mars ( " Ah !
Qu'ai - je dit " ) .
De Thou draws up the plan which has been prepared for the escape of Cinq-Mars the next day .
When the chancellor and Father Joseph come to announce that the marquis will die before the dawn , it becomes clear that this plan will not happen ( " Messieurs , appelez à vous , votre courage " ) .
Before Cinq-Mars is brought to the gallows , he sings with de Thou a final prayer .

Al Khuwayr is a settlement in Qatar , located in the municipality of Ash Shamal .
History Al Khuwayr was previously known as Khor Hassan , literally meaning ' beautiful inlet ' .
In the late 18th century , Rahmah ibn Jabir al-Jalahimah settled Al Khuwayr .
It served as his base of operations against the Al Khalifa in Bahrain .
Rahmah 's base in Al Khuwayr was surrounded by a protected bay which rendered the area a conceivably difficult target for his enemies .
He resided in a fort with mud walls and there were only a few huts in the vicinity.J.G .
Lorimer 's Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf gives an account of Al Khuwayr in 1908 : A village on the west coast of the Qatar promontory about 10 miles from its northern extremity .
It is frequently spoken of simply as " Khuwair " in contradistinction to " Khor " on the opposite side of the pronontory .
Khuwair possesses a tribal fort in a good state of repair and is inhabited by about 80 families of the Kibisah [ Qubaisi ] tribe , who live solely by pearl diving and fishing ; they have 20 pearl boats [ manned by 240 men ] , 5 fishing boats and 20 camels , but no other resources of any sort .
Drinking water is fetched from Thaqab , about 3 miles to the south-east .
A small islet off Khuwair Hassan is known as Jazirat-al-Khuwair .
Education The settlement 's first formal school was opened in 1957 .

Ziehl-Abegg SE ( own notation ZIEHL-ABEGG SE , until 2013 Ziehl-Abegg AG ) is a German manufacturer of fans for ventilation and air conditioning applications , as well as drive technology for elevators and motors with matching control technology .
The company 's headquarters are in Kuenzelsau , in Hohenlohekreis , Germany.The group ownsZIEHL-ABEGG SE , Künzelsau ( Headquarters ) Ziehl-Abegg Automotive GmbH & Co. .
KG , Künzelsauas well as all international subsidiaries .
History In 1897 , Emil Ziehl developed the first external rotor motor .
In early 1910 , the Ziehl-Abegg Electricity Company was founded in Berlin .
Emil Ziehl and the Swedish investor Eduard Abegg set up the company in Weißensee , a borough now part of the Pankow District.Emil Ziehl had big expectations for Abegg , who was to develop wind turbines .
After the company ’s logo ( with Abegg ’s name on it ) was already made public , Abegg failed to bring the promised funds .
The introduced patent for the wind motors also turned out to be unsuitable .
Abegg left the company that same year.The plant in Berlin was dismantled and taken to the Soviet Union after the German Surrender in 1945 , following orders of the Soviet Military Administration in Germany .
In 1947 , the brothers Günther and Heinz Ziehl re-established the company in the Künzelsau castle mill , this time in West Germany .
In 1960 began the production of an external rotor motor as a fan drive .
The internalisation of the company started in 1973 and , in 2001 , it became a family owned , joint-stock company.Sales subsidiaries can be found in Poland , China , Russia , USA , Czech Republic , Sweden , United Kingdom , Finland , France , Italy , Australia , Singapore , Switzerland , Austria , Ukraine , Spain , Benelux , South Africa , Japan , Turkey , India and Brasil.The founders of various competitors ( Gebhardt , ebm-papst and Rosenberg ) were employees of Ziehl-Abegg before starting their own company .
Wilhelm Gebhardt worked in the Development department , and Karl Rosenberg used to work in the Sales department until 1981 , when he left to set up his own firm .
Products The biggest division is the Ventilation division , in which axial and radial fans with a diameter from 190 mm to 1400 mm are produced .
Ziehl-Abegg also has two further divisions which produce drives and the corresponding control technology .
Application areas are i.e. Heat , clean room and refrigeration technology.In the late 1980s , Ziehl-Abegg became the first company in the world to introduce EC-Motors ( see Brushless DC electric motor ) and use them for Ventilation Technology .
In the 1990s , the rotor blades were sickled and in 2006 they were equipped with a bionic profile , in order to minimize the noise emissions .
In 2013 , Ziehl-Abegg was also the first company in the world to develop a Bio-Fan made entirely of a Bio-Polymer ( in this case castor oil ) .
In the drives division , Electrical Motors for lifts , medical applications ( i.e. Computer Tomographs ) and Omnibuses are developed .
Ziehl-Abegg Automotive At the International Motor Show Germany in 2012 , the associate company Ziehl-Abegg Automotive presented under the name ZAwheel a gearless in hub wheel drive for buses and other commercial vehicles with a synchronous external rotor motor.Buses equipped with ZAwheel are in line operation since 2008 , among others in Apeldoorn ( " The Whisperer " ) and Rotterdam ( " eBusz " ) .
Five buses equipped with ZAwheel started their tour in the German city Münster in April 2015 .
The ZAwheel SM530 model with 125 kW has a maximum torque of 6000 Nm .
The Efficiency is up to 90 % .
The retrofitting for conventional buses with a diesel engine is also possible .
Facilities Ziehl-Abegg SE The headquarters are located at the Heinz-Ziehl Street in Kuenzelsau , with a subsidiary plant in the nearby Würzburger Street .
Built in 2008 , the world 's largest and most modern air flow and noise level test chambers for fans can be found in the main production site.Further production sites are located in Schoental-Bieringen ( one facility ) and in the Günther-Ziehl Street in the Hohenlohe Industrial Park , Kupferzell ( ZA Kupferzell ) .
Ziehl-Abegg France SARL The production site of electrical motors and complete Fan Systems for the Refrigeration and ventilation industry is located in Villieu , Lyon .

In mathematics , Neumann -- Neumann methods are domain decomposition preconditioners named so because they solve a Neumann problem on each subdomain on both sides of the interface between the subdomains .
Just like all domain decomposition methods , so that the number of iterations does not grow with the number of subdomains , Neumann -- Neumann methods require the solution of a coarse problem to provide global communication .
The balancing domain decomposition is a Neumann -- Neumann method with a special kind of coarse problem.More specifically , consider a domain Ω , on which we wish to solve the Poisson equation − Δ u = f , u | ∂ Ω = 0 { \ displaystyle - \ Delta u = f , \ qquad u | _ { \ partial \ Omega } = 0 } for some function f. Split the domain into two non-overlapping subdomains Ω1 and Ω2 with common boundary Γ and let u1 and u2 be the values of u in each subdomain .
At the interface between the two subdomains , the two solutions must satisfy the matching conditions u 1 = u 2 , ∂ n u 1 = ∂ n u 2 { \ displaystyle u _ { 1 } = u _ { 2 } , \ qquad \ partial _ { n } u _ { 1 } = \ partial _ { n } u _ { 2 } } where n is the unit normal vector to Γ.An iterative method for approximating each ui satisfying the matching conditions is to first solve the decoupled problems ( i = 1,2 ) − Δ u i ( k ) = f i , u i ( k ) | ∂ Ω = 0 , u i ( k ) | Γ = λ ( k ) { \ displaystyle - \ Delta u _ { i } ^ { ( k ) } = f _ { i } , \ qquad u _ { i } ^ { ( k ) } | _ { \ partial \ Omega } = 0 , \ quad u _ { i } ^ { ( k ) } | _ { \ Gamma } = \ lambda ^ { ( k ) } } for some function λ ( k ) on Γ .
We then solve the two Neumann problems − Δ ψ i ( k ) = 0 , ψ i ( k ) | ∂ Ω = 0 , ∂ n ψ i ( k ) = ∂ n u 1 ( k ) − ∂ n u 2 ( k ) .
{ \ displaystyle - \ Delta \ psi _ { i } ^ { ( k ) } = 0 , \ qquad \ psi _ { i } ^ { ( k ) } | _ { \ partial \ Omega } = 0 , \ quad \ partial _ { n } \ psi _ { i } ^ { ( k ) } = \ partial _ { n } u _ { 1 } ^ { ( k ) } - \ partial _ { n } u _ { 2 } ^ { ( k ) } . }
We then obtain the next iterate by setting λ ( k + 1 ) = λ ( k ) − ω ( θ 1 ψ 1 ( k ) | Γ − θ 2 ψ 2 ( k ) | Γ ) { \ displaystyle \ lambda ^ { ( k +1 ) } = \ lambda ^ { ( k ) } - \ omega ( \ theta _ { 1 } \ psi _ { 1 } ^ { ( k ) } | _ { \ Gamma } - \ theta _ { 2 } \ psi _ { 2 } ^ { ( k ) } | _ { \ Gamma } ) } for some parameters ω , θ1 and θ2.This procedure can be viewed as a Richardson iteration for the iterative solution of the equations arising from the Schur complement method.This continuous iteration can be discretized by the finite element method and then solved -- in parallel -- on a computer .
The extension to more subdomains is straightforward , but using this method as stated as a preconditioner for the Schur complement system is not scalable with the number of subdomains ; hence the need for a global coarse solve .

Bishop Marrocco/Thomas Merton Catholic Secondary School and Regional Arts Centre ( referred to known as The Regional Arts School @ Marrocco , BMTMCSS , Bishop Marrocco/Thomas Merton , or simply Marrocco/Merton ) , originally known as Bishop Francis Marrocco Catholic Secondary School and St. Joseph 's Intermediate and Commercial School is a Catholic secondary school located in Toronto , Ontario , Canada .
History The schools were named after the Toronto Auxiliary Bishop who worked with Archbishop Pocock in the Archdiocese of Toronto 's great efforts in the 1960s to extend the availability of catholic secondary education and the American monk Thomas Merton .
One of the oldest catholic secondary schools in Toronto , Bishop Marrocco/Thomas Merton began as two schools .
In 1880 , the Sisters of St. Joseph established St. Joseph 's Intermediate and Commercial School in the Cabbagetown area as an all-girls commercial school .
Following the extension of funding for Catholic secondary schools by the province after 1984 , St. Joseph Commercial was renamed to Thomas Merton Catholic High School as a co-educational school .
The present day school , known as Bishop Francis Marrocco was officially established by the Metropolitan Separate School Board ( later rechristened as the Toronto Catholic District School Board ) on September 2 , 1986 using the facilities of Richard W. Scott Catholic Elementary School in the St. Clair/Dufferin area.The Marrocco and Merton schools were consolidated in September 1988 in the former West Park Secondary School on 1515 Bloor Street West in the Bloor/Dundas area , which was closed due to low enrollment and the property was ceded over to the MSSB as the new site of the school .
The original school consisted of Michael Monk as the first principal , 250 Marrocco students , 500 Merton students and 350 new grade 9 Marrocco/Merton students totaling to 1100 students.The arts program began in 2004 and the Arts and Culture High Skills program was launched in 2010 .

" Q " Is for Quarry is the 17th novel in Sue Grafton 's " Alphabet " series of mystery novels and features Kinsey Millhone , a private eye based in Santa Teresa , California .
Plot summary Characters Kinsey Millhone : Private investigator Reviews Development of the novel Though the book is a work of fiction , it is based on an unsolved homicide that occurred in Santa Barbara County , California in August 1969 .
A Jane Doe victim had been dumped near a quarry in Lompoc , California , and never identified .
At a dinner party , Sue Grafton had a conversation with Dr. Robert Failing , who mentioned the case .
He is the forensic pathologist who worked for the Coroner 's Office which had retained her maxilla and mandible .
The victim was never identified , and never associated with any known missing person 's case .
It was hoped that the additional publicity generated by the book ( along with the facial reconstruction done , funded by Grafton ) , would help turn up additional leads , but so far , unsuccessfully .
As of 2011 , the Santa Barbara County Sheriff 's Office is still hoping to find additional leads , and has the images of the facial reconstruction on their page .

Brown 's Island is an artificial continental island on the James River in Richmond , Virginia , formed by the Haxall Canal .
Part of the city 's James River Park , it is the popular venue of a large number of outdoor concerts and festivals in the spring and summer , such as the weekly Friday Cheers concert series or Dominion Riverrock .
The Rivanna Subdivision Trestle crosses over the island .
Geography Brown 's Island was formed in 1789 with the beginnings of the Haxall Canal .
For many years , there were two islands , Brown 's and Johnson 's Island with a spillway in between .
Today , the islands are one .
History Pre-industrial The island 's first settler was Elijah Brown , for whom it was named .
He acquired the land in 1826 .
A later owner named Neilson tried to rename the island as Neilson 's Island , but it did not last.During the American Civil War , the island was the home of the Confederate States Laboratory .
The C.S. Laboratory produced ammunition , friction primers , percussion caps , and other ordnance for the Confederate war effort .
On Friday , March 13 , 1863 , an explosion occurred in a section of the laboratory that killed forty five individuals and left twenty three others injured .
Most of the killed and injured were young girls who were the labor force used on the island .
Industrial age In 1894 , the Richmond Union Passenger Railway opened a coal power plant on the island .
In 1899 , a hydroelectric power plant on the island 's east side , running off the Haxall Canal .
Virginia Power also opened a coal power plant nearby in 1936 .
The trolley company 's plant did not last long , but reopened in 1916 as the Dixie Paper MillIn the 1950s and 60s , electricity production at the hydroelectric plant decreased , and ended altogether in 1968 .
In 1969 , the coal plant was damaged and shut down by flooding from Hurricane Camille .
In 1970 , the spillway between Johnson 's and Brown 's Islands was closed and the islands merged .
Hurricane Agnes also flooded and closed the coal power plant in 1972 , and the plant was closed altogether in 1975 .
Park In 1987 , the island became part of the city 's James River Parks System .
In 1993 , Paul Di Pasquale 's sculpture Headman was erected on the island 's East side , depicting a man steering a James Rier Batteaux boat .
In 1999 , the Army Corps of Engineers refurbished the Haxall canal into a canal walk .
The Dominion Virginia Power coal plant was renovated in 2005 by Cordish Company .
In 2014 , the City released plans for Brown 's Island Dam Walk and secured funding from the state of Virginia .
Sightseeing Beside being a music venue , the island is also home to pathways and is a popular place for sightseeing .
Visible from the island is the Belle Isle , the Manchester Bridge , and the ruins of the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad Bridge .
The Rivanna Subdivision Trestle crosses the island , making it a popular destination for railfans , too.A walkway extends south atop the old VEPCO Levee from the island into the James River , and another extends north along the Brown 's Island Dam .
Today Brown 's Island is an island that has ended up being attracted for concerts and outdoor events , such as the Earth Day Festival , Friday Cheers concert series , and in the fall , one of Virginia 's busiest and largest festival , the Richmond Folk Festival , which draws over 200,000 people each year .

The term Hachmei Provence refers to the Jewish rabbis of Provence , a province in southern France , which was a great Torah center in the times of the Tosafists .
The phrase literally means the wise of Provence.In matters of Halacha , as well as in their traditions and custom , the Provençal rabbis occupy an intermediate position between the Sephardic tradition of the neighboring Spanish scholars , and the Old French ( similar to the Ashkenazic ) tradition represented by the Tosafists.The term " Provence " in Jewish tradition is not limited to today 's administrative region of Provence but refers to the whole of Occitania .
This includes Narbonne ( which is sometimes informally , though incorrectly , transliterated as " Narvona " as a result of the back-and-forth transliteration between Hebrew and French ) , Lunel ( which is informally transliterated as " Lunil " ) , and the city of Montpellier , not far ( 7 km ) from the mediterranean coast .
It also included cities which at that time formed part of the Catalan political and cultural domain , such as Perpignan .
In some ways the Jewish traditions of Catalonia were closer to those of Provence than to those of Castile and southern Spain.There was a distinctive Provençal liturgy , used by the Jews of the Papal enclave of Comtat Venaissin , who remained following the expulsion of the Jews from the rest of France .
This liturgy was intermediate in character between the Sephardi and Ashkenazi rites , and was in some ways closer to the Italian rite than to either .
After the French Revolution , when Venaissin was annexed by France , the Provençal rite was replaced by the Portuguese liturgy , which is used by the Jews of Carpentras today .

G292 .0 +01.8 is a supernova remnant located in the constellation Centaurus .
It first gained notice as a strong radio source , and eventually deep images revealed a hot optical nebula at the location .
It lies about 15,000 light years away.The most notable feature of this remnant is its spectrum .
It shows no detectable lines of hydrogen and helium and the presence of only oxygen and neon .
The assumption is that a massive star burned through its hydrogen , producing oxygen and neon , and exploded before processing any heavier elements .
It must have taken place relatively recently , as the oxygen and neon have not yet mixed with the interstellar hydrogen .
An upper limit of 1500 years has been suggested , and it must be at least a few hundred years old since there are no records from the European presence in the southern hemisphere noting a supernova at this location .
Perhaps there are indigenous inscriptions or pictographs that record the event , but they have not yet been discovered or , if so , their significance not yet realized .

Tai Pī is a province of Nuku Hiva , in the Marquesas Islands , an administrative subdivision of French Polynesia .
The settlement follows the line of the valley and the stream that passes from its mountainous island surroundings.Herman Melville ( known as ' Tommo ' in Melville 's narrative ) was famously marooned here when , as a young whaling ship sailor , he deserted ship with his shipmate , Toby Greene .
This experience which lasted a total of four weeks was the subject of Herman Melville 's first book Typee : A Peep at Polynesian Life .
He arrived the day the French sailed into Nuku Hiva and began firing their cannon , thus proclaiming it a French Protectorate.Melville 's story thus represents the tribe 's ( and all the Nuku Hiva islanders ' ) native way of life before their island 's opening-up to the outside world and the suppression that would follow .
Their lifestyle , surroundings & condition made the young Melville think he had stumbled into the Garden of Eden .
He portrays their daily life as joyful , nonchalant and innocent , and strikingly free of the worries of the Western World .
Man makes a living by simply foraging in the abundant tropical surroundings , and teaches his son himself , within the community .
There is almost no difference between the possessions of the islanders , and their homes are erected by everybody and not entirely fixed-abodes .
This way of life was to rapidly decline and change with the arrival of the Europeans , as explored in Melville 's second book , Omoo ( although Omoo has nothing to do with Tai Pī ) .
History Nuku Hiva Campaign During the wars between the Te I ' i and the Tai Pī in 1813 , the American navy Captain David Porter arrived in the frigate USS Essex and ten other armed ships on October 25 .
A shore party was landed and they claimed the island for the United States and constructed a small village , named Madisonville .
A fort and a dock was also built , the latter to refit the Essex .
Almost immediately Porter became involved in the tribal conflict .
The first expedition into the jungle was led by Lieutenant John Downes , He and forty others captured a fort held by 3,000 to 4,000 Happah warriors with the assistance of several hundred Te I ' is .
The victory forced the Happah to terms and they allied themselved with both the Americans and the Te I ' i .
A second expedition was led by Porter himself and he made an amphibious assault against the Tai Pī held coastline .
5,000 Te I ' is and Happahs accompanied the fleet in at least 200 war-canoes .
Though the landing was unopposed , Porter 's force of thirty men and a cannon led the march inland where they found another , more formidable , enemy fort .
Thousands of natives armed with rocks and spears , positioned in a formidable mountain fortress , were able to fend off their enemies .
The victory was short-lived however and Captain Porter followed up his landing with an expedition overland , bypassing the fort , to threaten the Tai Pī 's village center in Typee Valley as the Americans named it.When the column arrived at their destination it was November 30 of 1813 .
The first shots fired occurred after the Tai Pī 's attempted to ambush the column , the attack was beaten off and the Porter issued a messing warning that if the Tai Pī did not cease their resistance at once , he would destroy the villages .
After a little while of waiting , the hostiles seemed to ignore the demands so the expedition advanced .
An engagement ensued as the villages were burned .
In the end , the Americans and their Te I ' i and Happah allies had won at severe cost to the enemy , who sued for peace soon after .
The next few months were peaceful until May 1814 .
The War of 1812 between the United States and the United Kingdom was in its third year most of the American fleet was captured British privateers .
At least six British prisoners were at Nuku Hiva during the American operations against the natives , not including a number who volunteered to fight for Captain Porter .
But in December 1813 , Porter left Nuku Hiva to continue raiding British whalers .
He left behind only nineteen navy sailors and six prisoners under two midshipmen and United States Marine Corps Lieutenant John M. Gamble .
On May 7 , 1814 , a group of the British sailors mutinied , released the six prisoners and attacked the fort .
Gamble was wounded in the foot and taken captive with his remaining men on the corvette Seringapatam though the Americans were set adrift later that day.An Englishman , named Wilson , on the island was used as an interpreter by Porter and on May 9 he convinced the Te I ' i that Porter would not return which the natives were not happy about .
Wilson eventually persuaded the Te I ' is to cancel the alliance and attack .
Six American sailors were on the beach at Madisonville when the Te I ' is attacked , Four of the men were killed and one other man escaped wounded with a second survivor .
Gamble was alone on the Sir Andrew Hammond , one of the captured British ships .
While still recovering from his wound to the foot , two Te I ' i war-canoes attacked the ship .
The ship 's cannon were already loaded so Lieutenant Gamble stumbled from one gun to another , firing them as fast as he could .
Ultimately Gamble beat off the enemy attack single-handedly though after the deaths of four of his men in town , there was no choice but to abandon the colony with the remaining seven , all of whom were either wounded or ill .
After that the base was never again occupied by American forces .
Captain Porter , who intended to sail back to Nuku Hiva , was captured at the Battle of Valparaiso on March 28 .

It is a muscle of mastication.Unlike most of the muscles of the human body , which had been categorized several centuries ago , Sphenomandibularis was discovered in the mid-1990s at the University of Maryland at Baltimore .
The findings were published in 1996 .
Sphenomandibularis is considered by many sources to be a portion of the temporalis , rather than a distinct muscle .

Notes
Jessica Lea Mayfield ( born August 27 , 1989 ) is an American singer-songwriter from Kent , Ohio , United States .
She is known for her ominous song writing , with a plaintive minimalist style that draws on both country and rock music .
Early years Mayfield first performed with her family bluegrass band One Way Rider at the age of 8 .
They began touring as a family band , boarding a 1956 tour bus ( once belonging to Bill Monroe , Kitty Wells , and Ernest Tubb ) and headed south from Ohio to Tennessee .
At age 11 , Mayfield began playing guitar and writing songs .
Studio work White Lies At age 15 , Mayfield recorded her first album White Lies under the moniker " Chittlin " produced by her brother David Mayfield , printing only a few hundred copies .
One of those copies fell into the hands of Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys .
After an introduction , Mayfield and Auerbach hit the studio , laying the foundation of her debut album With Blasphemy So Heartfelt .
With Blasphemy So Heartfelt Mayfield 's first LP was the September 16 , 2008 release With Blasphemy So Heartfelt .
The album was produced by Auerbach and recorded over a two-year span in his home studio in Akron .
With Blasphemy So Heartfelt features Mayfield on acoustic guitar and vocals , Auerbach on a variety of instrumentation , and Mayfield ’s brother David on upright bass .
Dr. Dog ’s Scott McMicken and Frank McElroy provide vocal harmonies on the track “ I ’m Not Lonely Anymore . ”
Says Auerbach of the recording experience , “ I think she ’s dark and moody in a mysterious way , not unlike Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds . ”
He adds , “ I ’m just always really excited to make music with her . ”
With Blasphemy So Heartfelt debuted with quite a buzz around it .
Pitchfork Media gave the record a rating of 8.2 out of 10 .
Online magazine Blurt named With Blasphemy the Best Album of 2008 and gave Mayfield the title of Best New Artist of 2008 .
The album 's opening track " Kiss Me Again " was featured on The CW 's hit series Gossip Girl on February 2 , 2009 , and " Bible Days " was featured on CBS 's CSI : NY . "
For Today " is featured on the Starbucks compilation Have You Heard ?
: Winter ' 09 .
Mayfield 's cover of the Buddy Holly song " Words of Love " is featured on the Starbucks compilation Sweetheart : Our Favorite Artists Sing Their Favorite Love Songs .
Tell Me Mayfield released her second LP Tell Me on February 8 , 2011 .
Make My Head Sing Mayfield released her alternative rock album " Make My Head Sing " in 2014 .
Pitchfork said , " Jessica Lea Mayfield ’s third album opens with the loud , percussive crunch and grind of an electric guitar , thudding loudly and precipitously -- Co-producing with her bass player and husband Jesse Newport , Mayfield keeps the sound loose and roomy , preserving the effect of three musicians huddled in a cramped practice space .
There ’s something certainly compelling about this raw , minimalist sound . "
The album is her first without Auerbach 's influence .
Seth Avett and Jessica Lea Mayfield Sing Elliott Smith Mayfield and Seth Avett of the Avett Brothers released an album of Elliott Smith cover songs in 2015 .
Collaborations In 2007 , Mayfield lent her voice to the track " Things Ai n't Like They Used To Be " on The Black Keys ' album Attack & Release produced by Danger Mouse , making her the first guest vocalist to appear on any record released by The Black Keys.Mayfield collaborated with Auerbach again on his 2009 debut solo release Keep It Hid , lending her vocals to the track " When the Night Comes " .
Sorry is Gone On September 29 , 2017 , Mayfield 's fourth studio LP Sorry is Gone was released by ATO Records : with the exception of the song " Offa My Hands " , which was produced by Patrick Damphier , who has worked with The Mynabirds and The Arcs , the album was produced by John Agnello , who has worked with Dinosaur Jr and Sonic Youth , and includes appearances by Seth Avett and Steve Shelley of Sonic Youth .
Sorry is Gone was another nod to Mayfield 's grunge-alternative influences , while incorporating some alt-country and pop elements as well.The deeply personal album chronicles Mayfield 's years-long journey as a survivor of domestic abuse , and separation from her abusive husband : " I feel like it ’s almost my duty and my responsibility to advocate for this subject .

Vyankatesh Digambar Madgulkar ( 6 July 1927 - 28 August 2001 ) was one of the most popular Marathi writers of his time .
He became well-known mainly for his realistic writings about village life in a part of southern Maharashtra called Maandesh , set in a period of 15 to 20 years before and after Independence .
He was often called Tatya ( “ old man ” , or “ grand old man ” in Marathi ) by his admirers , friends and family members Life Madgulkar was born in the village of Madgul in Sangli District of Maharashtra .
His father was in the employment of the government of the Aundh princely state .
His brother was the famous poet G. D. Madgulkar.When Madgulkar was in his teens , he left home and joined a group of nationalists fighting for India ’s freedom from the British Raj .
For these activities , the British government banned him as a criminal for two years.After independence , Madgulkar returned home .
Though he had never finished his high school education , but he passed vernacular final Marathi 7th exam with good marks .
He got a school teacher job at Nimbawade village that time he was only 14 years old .
he had a keen interest in reading .
He taught himself to read English on his own so that he could become familiar with English as well as Marathi literature .
He cited especially the influence of John Steinbeck , George Orwell and Liam O'Flaherty .
Madgulkar also had an aptitude for sketching and painting , so he went to Kolhapur to take painting lessons .
While studying there , at age 19 , he entered a competition for short story writing and won a prize .
This encouraged him to pursue a literary career rather than painting.In 1948 , when he was 21 , he became a journalist and , two years later , he moved to Mumbai where he had the opportunity to write scripts for a few Marathi movies.In 1955 , Madgulkar took a job in Pune in the rural programming department of All India Radio .
He worked there for the next 40 years .
During all those years , he wrote abundantly.He died in 2001 after an unspecified prolonged illness .
Writings Madgulkar wrote 8 novellas , over 200 short stories , about 40 screenplays , and some folk plays ( लोकनाट्य ) , travelogues , and essays on nature .
He translated some English books into Marathi , especially books on wild life , as he was an avid hunter .
This led to his nickname " Colonel Bahadur " .
He published his first book , Mandeshi Manse ( माणदेशी माणसे ) in 1949 when he was 22 .
His 1954 novella Bangarwadi ( बानगरवाडी ) was translated in several languages , including English , German , and Hindi .
His novel Wawtal ( वावटळ ) was translated into English , Kannada and also in Russian by raduga publishers .
A movie based on Bangarwadi was made under the direction of Amol Palekar .

Polar Class ( PC ) refers to the ice class assigned to a ship by a classification society based on the Unified Requirements for Polar Class Ships developed by the International Association of Classification Societies ( IACS ) .
Seven Polar Classes are defined in the rules , ranging from PC 1 for year-round operation in all polar waters to PC 7 for summer and autumn operation in thin first-year ice.The IACS Polar Class rules should not be confused with International Code for Ships Operating in Polar Waters ( Polar Code ) by the International Maritime Organization ( IMO ) .
Background The development of the Polar Class rules began in the 1990s with an international effort to harmonize the requirements for marine operations in the polar waters in order to protect life , property and the environment .
The guidelines developed by the International Maritime Organization ( IMO ) , which were later incorporated in the Polar Code , made reference to the compliance with Unified Requirements for Polar Ships developed by the International Association of Classification Societies ( IACS ) .
In May 1996 , an " Ad-Hoc Group to establish Unified Requirements for Polar Ships ( AHG/PSR ) " was established with one working group concentrating on the structural requirements and another working on machinery-related issues .
The first IACS Polar Class rules were published in 2007 .
Prior to the development of the unified requirements , each classification society had their own set of ice class rules ranging from Baltic ice classes intended for operation in first-year ice to higher vessel categories , including icebreakers , intended for operations in polar waters .
When developing the upper and lower boundaries for the Polar Classes , it was agreed that the highest Polar Class vessels ( PC 1 ) should be capable of operating safely anywhere in the Arctic or the Antarctic waters at any time of the year while the lower boundary was set to existing tonnage operating during the summer season , most of which followed the Baltic ice classes with some upgrades and additions .
The lowest Polar Class ( PC 7 ) was thus set to the similar level with the Finnish-Swedish ice class 1A .
The definition of operational conditions for each Polar Class was intentionally left vague due to the wide variety of ship operations carried out in polar waters .
Definition Polar Class notations The IACS has established seven different Polar Class notations , ranging from PC 1 ( highest ) to PC 7 ( lowest ) , with each level corresponding to operational capability and strength of the vessel .
The descriptions given in the rules are intended to guide owners , designers and administrations in selecting the appropriate Polar Class to match the intended voyage or service of the vessel .
Ships with sufficient power and strength to undertake " aggressive operations in ice-covered waters " , such as escort and ice management operations , can be assigned an additional notation " Icebreaker " .
The lowest Polar Classes ( PC 6 and PC 7 ) are roughly equivalent to the two highest Finnish-Swedish ice classes ( 1A Super and 1A , respectively ) .
However , unlike the Baltic ice classes intended for operation only in first-year sea ice , even the lowest Polar Classes consider the possibility of encountering multi-year ice ( " old ice inclusions " ) .
Requirements In the Polar Class rules , the hull of the vessel is divided longitudinally into four regions : " bow " , " bow intermediate " , " midbody " and " stern " .
All longitudinal regions except the bow are further divided vertically into " bottom " , " lower " and " icebelt " regions .
For each region , a design ice load is calculated based on the dimensions , hull geometry and ice class of the vessel .
This ice load is then used to determine the scantlings and steel grades of structural elements such as shell plating and frames in each location .
The design scenario used to determine the ice loads is a glancing impact with ice.In addition to structural details , the Polar Class rules have requirements for machinery systems such as the main propulsion , steering gear , and systems essential for the safety of the crew and survivability of the vessel .
For example , propeller-ice interaction should be taken into account in the propeller design , cooling systems and sea water inlets should be designed to work also in ice-covered waters , and the ballast tanks should be provided with effective means of preventing freezing .
Although the rules generally require the ships to have suitable hull form and sufficient propulsion power to operate independently and at continuous speed in ice conditions corresponding to their Polar Class , the ice-going capability requirements of the vessel are not clearly defined in terms of speed or ice thickness .
In practice , this means that the Polar Class of the vessel does reflect the actual icebreaking capability of the vessel .
Polar Class ships The IACS Polar Class rules apply for ships contracted for construction on or after 1 July 2007 .
This means that while vessels built prior to this date may have an equivalent or even higher level of ice strengthening , they are not officially assigned a Polar Class and may not in fact fulfill all the requirements in the unified requirements .
In addition , particularly Russian ships and icebreakers are only assigned ice classes according to the requirements of the Russian Maritime Register of Shipping which maintains its own ice class rules parallel to the IACS Polar Class rules.Although a number of ships have been built to the two lowest Polar Classes which correspond to the two highest Baltic ice classes , there are only a handful of vessels assigned ice class PC 5 or higher .
While the 2012-built drillship Stena IceMAX has a hull strengthened according to PC 4 requirements , the vessel is not capable of independent operation in ice and as a whole has ice class PC 6 .
The South African polar research vessel S. A. Agulhas II , also delivered in 2012 , was the first ice-capable vessel built to ice class PC 5 .
The Canadian-flagged icebreaking bulk carrier Nunavik , operated by Fednav and used to transport copper and nickel from the Nunavik Nickel Project , was built to ice class PC 4 in 2014 .
The new Finnish icebreaker Polaris was built in 2016 to the same ice class with additional notation " Icebreaker ( + ) " where the last notation refers to additional structural strengthening based on analysis of the vessel 's operational profile and potential ice loading scenarios .
The Netherlands-based ZPMC-Red Box Energy Services operates two PC 3 class deck cargo ships , Audax and Pugnax , which were built in 2016 .
In addition , China and Norway are currently building icebreaking polar research vessels to the same ice class.As of 2017 , there are no ships in operation or under construction to IACS Polar Classes higher than PC 3 .
In December 2017 , the French cruise ship operator Compagnie du Ponant announced an order for an icebreaking PC 2 ice class cruise ship capable of taking tourists to the North Pole .
The proposed Canadian polar icebreaker , CCGS John G. Diefenbaker , is designed to ice class PC 2 Icebreaker ( + ) .

Joseph Farmer Knipe ( March 30 , 1823 -- August 18 , 1901 ) was a brigadier general in the Union Army during the American Civil War .
His troops won a decisive victory in late 1864 that helped clear Tennessee of Confederates during the Franklin-Nashville Campaign .
Biography Joseph F. Knipe was born to a blacksmith and his wife in Mount Joy , Pennsylvania .
As a youth , he was apprenticed to a cobbler in Philadelphia .
In 1842 , he left his employment and enlisted in the United States Army in the 2nd U.S. Artillery .
He rose to the rank of Sergeant and served in the Mexican-American War .
He was discharged in 1847 and took employment with the fledgling railroad industry in Harrisburg .
Later he was involved in the mercantile business .
Knipe enrolled in the Pennsylvania state militia and became a major and aide-de-camp to Brig. Gen. Edward Williams.With the bombardment of Fort Sumter in April 1861 and the subsequent Federal call for troops to put down the rebellion , volunteers flocked to Harrisburg to enlist in Pennsylvania 's newly commissioned regiments .
Williams and Knipe selected the site for the state 's new military training center , Camp Curtin .
In September 1861 , Governor Andrew Curtin commissioned Knipe as a colonel and authorized him to raise the 46th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry .
After cursory training , Knipe 's regiment was assigned to garrison duty at Harper 's Ferry.In the spring of 1862 , Knipe fought in the Valley Campaign against Stonewall Jackson 's forces .
He was wounded at the First Battle of Winchester .
He was again wounded at the Battle of Cedar Mountain .
Due to the chain of command changes necessitated during the Battle of Antietam by the death of XII Corps commander Joseph K. Mansfield , Knipe took command of the brigade of Samuel W. Crawford in the first division .
Crawford had taken command of the division when Alpheus Williams became acting corps commander.On April 15 , 1863 , Knipe was promoted to brigadier general , backdated to November 1862 .
He led first brigade first division XII Corps under Alpheus Williams which saw action at the Battle of Chancellorsville .
Suffering from lingering effects from his wounds and a bout with malaria , he temporarily left the Army of the Potomac and returned to Harrisburg .
He took command of a brigade of inexperienced New York militia and led it in pursuit of the retreating Army of Northern Virginia following the Battle of Gettysburg.Returning to his XII Corps brigade , Knipe went to the Western Theater and served in the Atlanta Campaign .
He took command of a division of Union cavalry during John Bell Hood 's incursion into Tennessee , and captured 6,000 Confederates and eight battleflags in a decisive victory over the retreating Army of Tennessee following the Battle of Nashville.Following the war , Knipe returned to Harrisburg , where he was appointed postmaster by President Andrew Johnson .
He subsequently held a number of political patronage positions the rest of his life , both on the Federal and state level .
For a term , he was postmaster of the United States House of Representatives.Knipe died at the age of 78 and was buried in the Harrisburg Cemetery .

In his capacity as Vice President of the General Assembly , he presided over the Assembly 's function to congratulate the then UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan upon his receiving the Nobel Prize .
and many other important activities including the launching of the Year of Mountains .
As Vice President of ECOSOC , Sharma was responsible for the Coordination Segment , and he performed his responsibility very successfully.Sharma also led , and participated in , his country 's delegation to important international conferences .
Notable among the delegations he led were the Almaty Conference on Landlocked Developing Countries and the follow-up conferences on HIV/AIDS , Children and Social Development .
He also participated in such world conferences as on Human Rights in Vienna , on Population in Cairo , on Social Development in Copenhagen , on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg , on Women in Beijing , and on Least Developed Countries in Rabat.During his work as Ambassador in New York , Sharma served as Vice Chairman of the UNICEF Executive Board and of the Least Developed Country Bureau .
In that capacity , he led the Board delegation to Brazil on a study tour and met several high officials in the country .
He was very active in promoting the interests of the least developed countries and landlocked developing countries at the United Nations.When he was Member of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions of the United Nations , Sharma supported the pro-democracy movement in Nepal and helped organize rallies in support of the movement and protests against King Gyanendra 's direct and dictatorial rule in his country .
He lobbied the American lawmakers , government and people as well as the United Nations against the Royal government in Nepal .
He also gave talk programs , wrote articles and gave keynote speeches to build Nepali and global public opinion against the regime .
Angered by these activities , the Royal government even sought to seize his passport and withdraw his pension.In 2007 , he worked as Consultant to Corporate Risk International , a Washington-based company from home , before getting appointed as Nepal 's ambassador to the United Kingdom.He has made presentations on different issues at Columbia University , New York University , Michigan State University , New School University , Williams College , and Institute for International Strategic Studies ( London ) , among others.Before going to New York , Sharma was Foreign Secretary of Nepal and engaged in many high level negotiations with several countries in the world , including India , China , Thailand , Burma , Russia , to name a few .
He helped Nepal successfully defuse the crisis created by the hijacking of the Indian Airlines flight from Kathmandu that was taken to Afghanistan .
During that time , he participated in several summits of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation ( SAARC ) and chaired the body 's Standing Committee as well as its sub-regional framework.He has done considerable work in the area of public administration .
Several of his reports on reforms of government entities and public enterprises , which he supervised while working with the Ministry of General Administration , have been implemented .
The then His Majesty 's Government of Nepal had appointed him coordinator of a working group to review and suggest restructuring of the Nepali bureaucracy in order to meet the basic needs of the Nepali people , and most of the group 's recommendations were implemented .
He worked as Consultant to many organizations and groups , including the Nepal Academy of Science and Technology soon after it was created and the High Level Administrative Reform Commission after the 1990 political change in Nepal .
He also worked with the Pay Commission of Nepal in 1992 , whose recommendations were largely implemented.Prior to becoming Foreign Secretary of Nepal , Sharma had worked as Special Secretary and Joint Secretary ( United Nations and International Law Division ) of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
He was instrumental in promoting the concept of Economic Diplomacy in Nepal .
As Joint Secretary ( Budget Division ) of the Ministry of Finance , Sharma helped the government reform the budget classification and items of expenditure .
Before that , he was also Joint Secretary t the Ministry of Home responsible for Drugs Control , Disaster Management and Immigration .
His experience includes his work as Under Secretary ( Administrative Reforms ) , Under Secretary ( Drugs Control ) , Section Officer for Foreign Aid at the Ministry of Finance and for the Americas at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Class III Officer at Nepal Food Corporation , Joint Accounts Officer at the National Commercial Bank ( Rastriya Banijya Bank ) .
He was also Assistant Lecturer at the Sano Thimi Campus of Tribhuvan University.He has served on the Boards of Directors of the Agriculture Development Bank , National Trading Limited , Nepal Transport Corporation , Kathmandu Valley Town Development Committee , and Institute of Foreign Affairs.He writes a column every two weeks for Republica , the largest English daily published from Kathmandu.Controversial sackingSharma was recalled in early 2009 after his controversial sacking by the then former foreign minister Upendra Yadav , who accused Sharma of acting against " diplomatic etiquette " by approaching the Prime Minister directly , bypassing Minister Yadav .
It is to be noted that Sharma was appointed envoy to UK by Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala in February 2008 , whereas Minister Yadav who accused Sharma of undiplomatic behavior was from the UCPN-Maoist-led government headed by Pushpa Kamal Dahal " Prachanda " .
After his sacking , Sharma sought political asylum in the UK claiming that his life would be at risk if he returned to Nepal .
Foreign Minister Yadav did not approve of his moves and accused Sharma of damaging the country 's image and prestige by seeking asylum in a country where he was once an ambassador .
He also termed Sharma 's claim that his life was under threat in Nepal bogus .
To this Sharma is reported to have told The Himalayan Times ( over the phone ) - " Since I do not hold any political or public post , it should bot be anybody 's concern if I stay here illegally or as a refugee . "
When asked why he had taken a step that would embarrass Nepal , he said , " I was kicked out in a humiliating manner .
Had I been recalled respectfully , I would have reciprocated in a similar vein .
It is my compulsion . "
Interestingly , he said he would return to Nepal as soon as his wife 's heart surgery was over in a hospital in London.Chief Secretary to the government Leela Mani Paudel told this correspondent that the government was working to frame an " appropriate policy " to deal with cases of former senior bureaucrats , including Sharma who was foreign secretary before his posting to the UN , who have stayed on abroad after being sent there in an official capacity .

Lovisa von Burghausen ( 1698 -- 20 January 1733 ) was a Swedish memoirist who became famous for her story about her time in captivity as a slave in Russia after being taken prisoner by the Russians during the Great Northern War .
She was sold as a slave several times before she eventually recovered her freedom , and her story became perhaps the most famous of the many stories of Carolinian fates of this period .
Kidnapped Lovisa was born in the city of Narva in Swedish Estonia , one of five daughters to the noble Swedish major Gustaf von Burghausen and Margareta von Brundert .
Her father had been taking part in the defence of the city when it was taken by the Russians after the Battle of Narva ( 1704 ) .
During the chaotic plundering of the city , Lovisa was separated from her family and taken captive by a Russian soldier ; it was a common practice for individual Russian soldiers and militaries to take civilians captive , whom they sold as slaves , and many of the citizens of Narva , both Swedes and Estonians , were to be sold at the slave markets in Russia and Turkey .
The perhaps most famous of all the civilian people taken captive was the future Empress Catherine I of Russia : another Swedish citizen taken captive as a slave during the Great Northern War possibly was Yefrosinya Fedorov .
Lovisa 's parents and sisters were taken captive as prisoners of war and deported to Siberia.On the way to the Russian camp , another soldier demanded to have her , and when the first one claimed that he intended to give her as a present to his captain , the second one wounded her in the chest with his sabre .
She fainted and woke up in a tent , where she cried for her mother until her throat was so swollen up she lost her voice and lost consciousness .
The first master She was taken to Moscow and given as present to the Russian general Prince Anikita Repnin .
He sent her to a nunnery for her to be converted to the Russian Orthodox faith , but unable to understand Russian , she was beaten as a pagan unwilling to convert .
After three months , she was released from the convent by the intervention of the Prince 's mother , the dowager princess , who showed her " all the tenderness of a mother " .
However , the prince 's wife , Princess Prascovia Narischkyn , suspected her to be the spy of her husband on her private affairs and often abused her ; at one occasion , she had Lovisa hung upside down in the garden , which would have killed her had the old dowager princess not once again intervened.She was to accompany the princely family to Ukraine in 1709 and witness the Swedish army and prisoners march in under Russian captivity in the triumph of the czar Peter the Great in Moscow .
In 1710 , she was married to the chamberlain of the Prince , a sixteen-year-old Swedish son of an ensign , Johan , himself a captive and fostered in the Orthodox faith , and had a daughter who died six weeks later.In 1713 , Johan died from being shot in the leg during battle for the prince .
The same year , Prince Dimitrie Cantemir , hospodar of Moldavia , a Russian ally at the time , visited Moscow with his family .
During a visit to the Repnins , his wife , Kassandra Cantacuzene , gave Princess Prascovia a diamond as a gift ; she noticed Lovisa among the court of the princess , and Princess Prascovia then gave Lovisa to Princess Cantemir as thanks for the diamond .
Second master Princess Cantemir died the same year , and Lovisa was poisoned by the wife of the baker of the Cantemir court , who wanted Lovisa 's place for her daughter , and only with good medical help was she saved .
When an Armenian Captain asked the Prince to give Lovisa to him as a wife , she escaped and , on the advice of a fellow Swedish woman employed at the court , sought refuge at the home of an English merchant in the German Quarter of Moscow.The English merchant sent her to Archangelsk to be educated in the Protestant religion and to learn German .
After seven weeks , she was reported by a German tailor , arrested by the Russian police and taken back to prince Cantemir .
She was chained to her hands and feet and nails were hammered through her shoes to make it difficult for her to walk , which made her feet and legs swollen .
She was put to wash clothes in a stone-kitchen so cold that her arms were covered with ice .
She would have frozen to death if it were not for the daughters of the prince , Maria Cantemir and Smaragda ; they bribed the guard to fold her chains in cloth , to prevent it from giving any sound , and take her up to their bedchamber at night .
Third master In 1714 , prince Cantemir traveled to Saint Petersburg and left his household under the supervision of a captain Iwanof and his wife .
The wife of Iwanof took Lovisa , together with two other female slaves , one from Finland and one from Narva , to the Russian slave market in Moscow and sold them all .
The Finnish woman was sold to an Armenian , the woman from Narva to a Russian clerk , and Lovisa to a Turkish merchant .
She was sold for a bit of damask , a fan and a smaller sum of money .
She was put among the merchandise in the sleigh of the merchant , mostly consisted of carpets , threatened with beating if she screamed , and was taken towards Tobolsk in Siberia.During the journey , a Russian clerk saw Lovisa crying in an inn , and asked her what had happened .
She told him her story , and he reported it to the voivod of Solikamsk .
In Solikamsk , the voivod questioned the Turk , but let them go when the Turk told him that the person in his sleigh was an old Russian woman .
They then left Solikamsk without knowing , that this was the city where the parents of Lovisa lived as prisoners of war.At the home of the Turk in Tobolsk , Lovisa was put to hard labour and badly beaten every time she made a mistake of sheer exhaustion .
Tobolsk was , however , the city in Siberia containing the largest colony of Swedish prisoners of war , who were allowed to live there quite freely .
Lovisa took contact with a Swedish woman , who advised her to contact the Swedish lieutenant Magnus Vilhelm Sprengtporten ; Sprengtporten had been taken prisoner at Narva the same time as Lovisa , escaped , been taken prisoner at the Battle of Poltava , lead a rebellion at Kazan and been imprisoned for seventeen months .
Lovisa was later to say about him that he was her " greatest saviour next to God " .
Runaway slave One day , she left the house of the Turk to buy silk at the market , accompanied by a guard .
The guard was distracted by a game of sports , and Lovisa mixed with the crowd and made contact with Sprengtporten , who took her to his friend Mattias Johan Reutercrona , where she remained hidden for eleven weeks .
The Turk issued a reward of § 100 and the police put a guard round the house , but Sprengporten helped her pass the guards by giving her a pack of clothes and saying that she was his maid on her way to the tailor 's .
She was taken to the house of Christoffer Laudau , which were searched after a tip from a servant who wanted the reward , during which she had to hide three days in water under a tub in the basement .
She was then hidden in a number of houses .
Once in the house of her mother 's relative , Lovisa Patkull , who lived in a house belonging to the vice governor ; during a visit from the vice governor , Patkull put her in bed claiming her to be her sick niece.Reutercrona and Sprengtporten were arrested , suspected of aiding her to escape , and she was arranged to be taken from the city to Japantskin on her way to her parents in Solikamsk by a Russian farmer ; the son of the farmer , Stefan , was kept as security , and Lovisa was dressed as a boy and left with the farmer by sleigh .
In a village , the villagers suspected her to be the disguised son of a noble , and planned to kill her in her sleep .
A maid warned her and Lovisa jumped out of the cottage to the farmer , who was feeding the horse , and up to the sleigh , and they quickly fled form the village .
During the night , they rested on the side of the road , and soon after , they heard noise and then saw the villagers hunting after them with dogs .
Luckily , it was snowing , and their traces were concealed.In Japantskin , Lovisa was taken care of by the Swedish priest Anders Bergner ; the Swedish noblewoman Anna von Knorring , who was visiting her daughters in Klinov , obtained a pass for Lovisa as her niece , and they then traveled together to Solikamsk , where Lovisa where directed to her parents in the Swedish colony by the Swedish army priest Christoffer von der Heide on Christmas morning 1718 .
Later life Lovisa was now alone with her parents after all of her sisters had been married to officers .
Her parents arranged for her to be instructed in Lutheranism by the priest of the Swedish colony , Lars Sandmark .
In 1720 , her parents forced her to marry the thirty years older priest , which she did " with childlike obedience " .
When the Swedish prisoners were released after the war in 1721 , she followed her husband to Sweden , where he was appointed vicar in Njurunda in Medelpad .
Contemporary accounts say that she made the home bright with her kindness towards others .
In 1729 , she became a widow , and in 1731 , she married her husband 's successor , Petrus Sundberg , in accordance with the Widow Conservation practice .
She died childless in 1733 after the bad health she had after her time as a slave.The story of Lovisa von Burghausen was written down by " an honest man of the priest cloth " after her words and was read at her funeral .
It is now kept at Biografica in Riksarkivet ( the national archives ) in Sweden .
Context Many Swedish , Finnish and Baltic people , especially women and children , had been sold as slaves in Russia and Turkey during the Great Northern War after having been taken captive by Russian soldiers , particularly after the fall of Narva in 1704 .
Many were then sold in the slave market in Istanbul ; from June 1710 , the Swedish ambassador Thomas Funck regularly visited the slave auctions in Istanbul to buy Swedish citizens , and Sven Agrell noted that they , among others , had bought a " carpenter 's daughter " from Narva for § 82 , a " Captain 's wife " for § 240 , Catharina Pereswetoff-Morath , eighteen years old , for § 275 and a whole family , Anders Jonsson and his wife and children , though the funds were not always enough to buy all .
The people bought free were probably taken to the camp of the king Charles XII of Sweden in Moldavia and returned to Sweden with him .
In the peace treaty of 1721 , the Russian czar allowed all prisoners in Russia to return home , except those who had converted to the Russian religion , as this was considered to make them Russian citizens ; but as the Swedish slaves had been forced to convert to the orthodox faith by their masters , they were kept in Russia .
If it could be proven that they had been forced to convert , they would sometimes be let free , but forced to stay as free Russian citizens instead ; the forced conversions could generally not be proven .
The story of Lovisa von Burghausen is the perhaps best known of the many women being taken as slaves during this war .

The Boxer Movement , or Boxer Rebellion , was a Chinese uprising from November 1899 to September 7 , 1901 , against foreign influence in areas such as trade , politics , religion and technology that occurred in China during the final years of the Manchu rule ( Qing Dynasty ) .
The members of the Chinese Society of Righteous and Harmonious Fists were simply called boxers by the Westerners due to the martial arts and calisthenics they practiced .
It began as an anti-foreign , anti-imperialist , peasant-based movement that attacked foreigners who were building railroads and violating Feng shui .
Christians who they felt were responsible for foreign domination of China were also targeted .
In June 1900 , the Boxers invaded Beijing and killed 230 non-Chinese .
The Qing commander in chief Ronglu expelled the Boxers from the city .
The Qing ordered foreign diplomats and personnel to leave to Tianjin but they refused and stay put in the legation quarter of Beijing.After the foreign attack at the Battle of Taku Forts ( 1900 ) and the foreign invasion in the Seymour Expedition the government of Empress Dowager Cixi ordered the Kansu Braves to surround the foreign diplomats , civilians , soldiers and some Chinese Christians in the legation quarter .
The " siege " lasted 55 days until a multinational coalition rushed 20,000 troops to their rescue in the Gaselee Expedition .
The Chinese government was forced to indemnify the victims and make many additional concessions .
Subsequent reforms implemented after the crisis of 1900 laid the foundation for the end of the Qing Dynasty and the establishment of the modern Chinese Republic.The Medal of Honor was created during the American Civil War and is the highest military decoration presented by the United States government to a member of its armed forces .
The recipients must have distinguished themselves at the risk of their own life above and beyond the call of duty in action against an enemy of the United States .
Due to the nature of this medal , it is commonly presented posthumously.During the Boxer rebellion , 59 American servicemen received the Medal of Honor for their actions .
Four of these were for Army personnel , twenty-two went to navy sailors and the remaining thirty-three went to marines .
Harry Fisher was the first Marine to receive the medal posthumously and the only posthumous recipient for this conflict .

Neisseria lactamica is a gram-negative diplococcus bacterium .
It is strictly a commensal species of the nasopharynx .
Uniquely among the Neisseria they are able to produce β-D-galactosidase and ferment lactose .
[ 1 ] This species is most commonly carried by young children .
There is an inverse relationship between colonisation by N. lactamica and Neisseria meningitidis .
[ 2 ] Carriage of N. lactamica has been associated with decreased incidence of invasive meningococcal disease .
[ 3 ] However , resistance to penicillin and other beta-lactams may be transmitted from commensal neisseriae such as Neisseria lactamica to disease-causing Neisseria meningitidis by the process of genetic transformation .

The Monumenta Estoniae Antiquae is a corpus of Estonian folksongs which contains around 800,000 pages of manuscript , including 100,000 songs in the standard trochaic dimeter form .
This corpus is one of the largest and most significant of its kind in the world .
History Interest in Estonian folklore began at the beginning of the 19th century .
The Learned Estonian Society was established in 1839 as the central organisation for the collection and study of Estonian folklore .
It was this society that coordinated the compilation of the Estonian epic Kalevipoeg , begun by Friedrich Robert Faehlmann and completed by Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald.In 1843 Kreutzwald initiated the idea of the systematic collection of Estonian folklore .
Alexander Neus , under the auspices of the Society of Estonian Literati ( Eesti Kirjameeste Selts ) founded in 1842 , published a three volume anthology of Estonian folksongs in 1852 .
This three volume set of some 1300 songs is considered the first scholarly publication.Soon after Dr. Jakob Hurt assumed the presidency of the Estonian Literati Society in 1872 , a project was initiated for the systematic collection of folklore across Estonia .
Both collecting and editing was coordinated by Jakob Hurt , organising around 1400 volunteer collectors through appeals , through the press , brochures and personal correspondence .
Hurt had planned the publication of a six volume series to be called the " Monumenta Estoniae Antiquae " .
Between 1875 and 1886 two volumes of folksongs were published under the serial title Vana Kannel , ( in German Alte Harfe ) .
Each volume contained the total material from one parish ( kihelkond ) , thus establishing a principle of geographical and dialectal , rather than thematic , unity .
Vana Kannel I gathered up the songs of the Põlva parish in south-eastern Estonia , and volume II included those of Kolga-Jaani in central Estonia .
Hurt was about to complete a third volume , the songs of the Viljandi parish in central Estonia , but difficulties of publishing and the continual inflow of new material intervened.Between 1904 and 1907 , under the auspices of the Finnish Literature Society , Hurt published a three volume series of songs ( Setukeste laulud ) from the Setumaa district in southern Estonia .
Later in 1907 Jakob Hurt died.During the 1930s the Estonian Folklore Archives revived Hurt 's original project and published volumes III and IV of Vana Kannel in 1938 and 1941 respectively .
Edited by Herbert Tampere the third volume contains songs of Kuusalu Parish and the fourth volume songs of Karksi parish .
A fifth volume containing songs from Muhu island was under preparation , however World War II intervened .
At that point songs from only four parishes and Setumaa , out of a total of 112 parishes were in print.During the Soviet period , the Monumenta Estoniae Antiquae project was revived in the mid-1950s , with an additional 40 volumes planned .
The plan was to publish a volume on the Haljala parish on the island of Saaremaa in 1960 , then publish one volume per year for the next 40 years through the joint efforts of the Museum of Literature and Tartu University .
However nothing came of that plan until 1985 , when Vana Kannel 5 ( Mustjala parish ) was published .
Kannel 6 ( Haljala parish ) was published in 1989 .
On the resumption of independence , volumes 7 ( Kihnu parish ) and 8 ( Jõhvi and Iisaku parishes ) were published in 1997 and 1999 respectively .

DMIF , or Delivery Multimedia Integration Framework , is a uniform interface between the application and the transport , that allows the MPEG-4 application developer to stop worrying about that transport .
DMIF was defined in MPEG-4 Part 6 ( ISO/IEC 14496-6 ) in 1999 .
DMIF defines two interfaces : the DAI ( DMIF/Application Interface ) and the DNI ( DMIF-Network Interface ) .
A single application can run on different transport layers when supported by the right DMIF instantiation .
MPEG-4 DMIF supports the following functionalities : A transparent MPEG-4 DMIF-application interface irrespective of whether the peer is a remote interactive peer , broadcast or local storage media.Control of the establishment of FlexMux channelsUse of homogeneous networks between interactive peers : IP , ATM , mobile , PSTN , narrowband ISDN.Support for mobile networks , developed together with ITU-TUserCommands with acknowledgment messages.Management of MPEG-4 Sync Layer informationDMIF expands upon the MPEG-2 DSM-CC standard ( ISO/IEC 13818-6 :1998 ) to enable the convergence of interactive , broadcast and conversational multimedia into one specification which will be applicable to set tops , desktops and mobile stations .
The DSM-CC work was extended as part of the ISO/IEC 14496-6 , with the DSM-CC Multimedia Integration Framework ( DMIF ) .
DSM-CC stands for Digital Storage Media - Command and Control .
DMIF was also a name of working group within Moving Picture Experts Group .
The acronym " DSM-CC " was replaced by " Delivery " ( Delivery Multimedia Integration Framework ) in 1997 .

Stowey Castle ( or Nether Stowey Castle known locally as The Mount ) was a Norman motte-and-bailey castle , built in the 11th century , in the village of Nether Stowey on the Quantock Hills in Somerset , England .
It has been designated as a Scheduled Ancient Monument .
Details The Castle is sited on a small isolated knoll of Leighland Slates of the Devonian series , about 390 feet ( 119 m ) high .
It consisted of a square keep , ( which may have been stone , or a wooden superstructure on stone foundations ) and its defences , and an outer and an inner bailey .
The mount is 29 feet ( 9 m ) above the 6 feet ( 2 m ) wide ditch which itself is 7 feet ( 2 m ) deep .
The motte has a flat top .
Central area occupied by approximately square foundations 33 feet ( 10 m ) by 33 feet ( 10 m ) with internal divisions.Alfred of Spain is the Norman Lord of Stowey recorded in Domesday and the building of the castle is normally attributed to him or to his daughter Isabel .
The earliest written reference to the castle is in a forged charter of 1154 .
The top of the motte was excavated by amateurs in the 19th Century but no record was made of any finds .
The mounds around the top of the motte are assumed to be spoil heaps from these excavations to clear the foundations of the keep , although it has also been suggested that they may be the remains of towers .
The blue lias rubble foundations are the only visible structural remains of the castle which stood on the conical motte surrounded by a ditch approximately 820 feet ( 250 m ) in circumference.The castle was destroyed in the 15th century , which may have been as a penalty for the local Lord Audley 's involvement in the Second Cornish Uprising of 1497 led by Perkin Warbeck .
Some of the stone was used in the building of Stowey Court in the village .

The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships ( APPS , 33 U.S.C. § § 1905-1915 ) is a United States law that implements the provisions of MARPOL and the annexes to which the United States is a party .
The most recent U.S. action concerning MARPOL occurred in April 2006 , when the U.S. Senate approved Annex VI , which regulates air pollution ( Treaty Doc .
108-7 , Exec .
Rept .
109-13 ) .
Following that approval , in March 2007 , the House of Representatives approved legislation to implement the standards in Annex VI ( H.R. 802 ) , through regulations to be promulgated by Environmental Protection Agency in consultation with the U.S. Coast Guard.APPS applies to all U.S.-flagged ships anywhere in the world and to all foreign-flagged vessels operating in navigable waters of the United States or while at port under U.S. jurisdiction .
The Coast Guard has primary responsibility to prescribe and enforce regulations necessary to implement APPS in these waters .
The regulatory mechanism established in APPS to implement MARPOL is separate and distinct from the Clean Water Act and other federal environmental laws.The H.R. 6665 legislation was passed by the 96th U.S. Congressional session and signed by the 39th President of the United States Jimmy Carter on October 21 , 1980 .

Ponden Hall is a farmhouse near Stanbury in West Yorkshire , England .
It is famous for reputedly being the inspiration for Thrushcross Grange , the home of the Linton family , Edgar , Isabella , and Cathy , in Emily Brontë 's novel Wuthering Heights .
However , it does not match the description given in the novel and is closer in size and appearance to the farmhouse of Wuthering Heights itself.The Brontё biographer Winifred Gerin believed that Ponden Hall was the original of Wildfell Hall , the old mansion where Helen Graham , the protagonist of Anne Brontë 's The Tenant of Wildfell Hall , fled from her husband .
Ponden shares certain architectural details with Wildfell : latticed windows , a central portico and date plaque above.The " old house " was built in 1634 by Robert Heaton ( 1587 -- 1641 ) for his son , Michael Heaton ( 1609 -- 1643 ) , although the east end incorporates an older building from 1541 .
The " old porch and peat house " was later built by Michael 's son Robert ( 1642 -- 1704 ) and in 1801 the hall was re-built by his great-grandson , Robert Heaton ( 1757 -- 1817 ) .
The old house was demolished in 1956 .
In the early 19th century Ponden Hall held what was reputedly the largest private library in Yorkshire , which saw regular visits from Brontё children as they and the Heaton children would play together as well .
There are two entwined withered pear trees on the property , said to be planted there by one of the boys , Robert , as he longed for Emily 's heart ( was not meant to be as she was a little older ) .
In the 19th century the Heaton family were textile manufacturers -- particularly wool .
With the death of Robert in 1898 , the last surviving Heaton male , the Hall was sold .
The final Heaton male , George Smith Heaton , the son of Michael and Ellen Heaton of Royd House , finally died penniless at the Bendigo Benevolent Asylum in Victoria , Australia , on 12 February 1901 .
The house is a Grade II * listed building and as of 2014 was a bed-and-breakfast establishment .

Physicians for Social Responsibility ( PSR ) is the largest physician-led organization in the US working to protect the public from the threats of nuclear proliferation , climate change , and environmental toxins .
Continuing its long history of physician-led activism , PSR produces and disseminates its own publications , provides specialized training , offers written and oral testimony to congress , conducts media interviews , and delivers professional and public education .
PSR ’s 50,000 members and e-activists , 30 state and local chapters , 39 student chapters , and 14 national staff form a nationwide network that target what they consider threats to global survival , specifically nuclear warfare , nuclear proliferation , global warming , and toxic degradation of the environment .
Organizational history PSR was founded in Boston in 1961 by a group of physicians concerned about the public health dangers associated with the testing , stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons .
Drs. Bernard Lown , Victor W. Sidel , Sidney Alexander , H. Jack Geiger , Alexander Leaf , George Saxton and Robert Goldwyn were among the founding group of physicians .
PSR 's initial reports described the real human , physical , social and environmental consequences of a nuclear war .
PSR originally opposed atmospheric nuclear testing by documenting the presence of testing byproduct strontium-90 in children 's teeth .
Rebirth of PSR in the late 1970s By 1973 the organization was not active and in effect ceased to exist .
In 1978 , Helen Caldicott , MD was asked by Arnold Relman , the then editor to write an article for the NEJM on the medical dangers of nuclear power .
She was subsequently visited by a young intern from Cambridge City Hospital at Children 's Hospital Medical Center where she worked in the cystic fibrosis unit , to ask for some relevant papers on nuclear power .
After some discussion with him , Caldicott said - you know this is a medical issue , let 's start a medical organization .
The first meeting held a week later at the Boston home of Helen and Bill Caldicott with several physicians in attendance including one who had been the past the secretary of the old PSR , Richard Feinbloom .
Feinbloom suggested that instead of bothering to incorporate a new organization in the State of Massachusetts , the group take the name of the old and then defunct Physicians for Social Responsibility and use it .
They did.This newly reinvigorated organization took off soon after .
One of the initial organizational actions was to place an ad in the New England Journal of Medicine outlining what they considered to be the medical implications of nuclear power .
The ad was serendipitously published the day after Three Mile Island melted down attracting 500 new members .
Over five years the new PSR recruited 23,000 physician members and organized approximately 153 chapters in the US .
Caldicott served as the President of PSR from 1978 until 1984 when she resigned .
Dr Caldicott travelled widely and founded similar physicians organizations in other countries including England , Ireland , Scotland , Japan , New Zealand , Canada , Holland , Germany , Belgium , Scandinavia , and Australia .
Founding of the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War ( IPPNW ) PSR 's work to educate the public about the dangers of nuclear war grew into an international movement with the founding of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War in 1980 .
In 1980 Bernard Lown co-founded , with Evgeni Chazov of the Soviet Union , IPPNW , with PSR as its American affiliate and branches in many other nations , to continue this educational effort on a global scale .
As the U.S. affiliate of this global professional network , PSR shared in the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize awarded to IPPNW " for spreading authoritative information and by creating an awareness of the catastrophic consequences of atomic warfare . "
PSR today Today , PSR 's security program works to improve national policy formulation and decision-making about nuclear weapons and technology through the combined efforts of credible , committed health professionals and active and concerned citizen members .
PSR articulates both the health threats and the security threats posed by nuclear weapons , as well as the importance of implementing new approaches to reduce U.S. reliance on nuclear weapons in national security policy .
PSR works to lead the U.S. toward the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons.Since 1992 , when PSR formally created its environment and health program , PSR has worked to address global warming and the toxic degradation of the environment .
PSR presses for policies to curb global warming , generate what they consider to be a sustainable energy future , minimize toxic pollution of air , food and drinking water , and prevent human exposure to toxic substances .
PSR 's Code Black program has been a voice in the movement to reduce U.S. reliance on coal-fired power plants .
Coal 's Assault on Human Health , released in November 2009 , is a groundbreaking report that reviews and summarizes the latest peer-reviewed medical literature on coal pollution , providing a full picture of how coal affects human health from mining to combustion to the disposal of post-combustion waste.In 2008 , concerned about the push to promote nuclear energy as the solution to environmental problems , PSR launched what they called a safe energy program aimed at stopping the construction of new nuclear power plants and to sound the alarm about what they consider to be the true costs of , and the dangers associated with , nuclear energy.Student Physicians for Social Responsibility ( SPSR ) , a network of 39 chapters and 650 students , mobilizes medical students to engage in the work against nuclear proliferation , environmental degradation , and social justice issues .
SPSR orients every new generation of medical students to be engaged in creating positive change through medical activism.PSR state and local chapters work on a range of issues , including the ' greening ' of hospitals , what they consider sustainable agriculture , health care reform , and domestic violence .
Several PSR chapters are also active in the gun control movement , working to ban handguns in the United States .

Psoroptes is a genus of mites , including the agents that cause psoroptic mange .
Psoroptic mange Psoroptes mites are responsible for causing psoroptic mange in various animals , leading to economic losses among farmers of cattle , sheep and goats .
It is also known as sheep scab and cattle scab .
The disease is highly infectious , and is transmitted via fenceposts and other structures that livestock use when scratching themselves .
The mites have mouthparts which do not pierce the skin , but are adapted to feeding on the surface , where the mites abrade the stratum corneum .
See Mites of livestock for photographs of infestations by Psoroptes .
Taxonomy Psoroptes has been traditionally considered to include five species living on different host species , but the degree of host specificity is thought to have been overestimated , and the genus has been reduced to a single species , Psoroptes equi .

Frances Ormond Jones Gaither ( May 21 , 1889 -- October 28 , 1955 ) was an American novelist whose major works depict slavery in the plantation South.Gaither was born in Somerville , Tennessee , but her family moved to Corinth , Mississippi , soon after her birth .
She graduated from the Mississippi State College for Women in 1909 and briefly taught high school English in Corinth .
Gaither and her husband , Rice , moved to New York City in 1929 , where he worked as a journalist and she pursued a writing career .
She produced four books for children in the 1930s -- three works of fiction , The Painted Arrow ( 1931 ) , The Scarlet Coat ( 1934 ) , Little Miss Cappo ( 1937 ) , and a biography of La Salle entitled The Fatal River ( 1931 ) Gaither is most renowned , however , for her trinity of novels for adult readers about American slavery -- Follow the Drinking Gourd ( 1940 ) , The Red Cock Crows ( 1944 ) , and Double Muscadine ( 1949 ) .
While long out of print , the second of these works is probably Gaither ’s most significant work -- a dramatic tale of a slave rebellion based on historical events in Hinds County , Mississippi in 1835 .

Tammukan is an alternate spelling of Tamcan , the name of a local tribe of Delta Yokuts-speaking natives in the U.S. that once lived on the lower reaches of California 's San Joaquin River in what is now eastern Contra Costa County and western San Joaquin County , California .
The Tamcans were absorbed into the system of the Spanish missions in California in the early nineteenth century ; they moved to Mission San José , near the shore of San Francisco Bay , between 1806 and 1811 .
At the mission , they and their descendants intermarried with speakers of the San Francisco Bay Ohlone , Plains Miwok , and Patwin Indian languages .
Mission Indian survivors of these mixed groups gathered at Alisal , near Pleasanton in Contra Costa County , in the late nineteenth century.It has been stated that Tammukan was a specific place , a lost city even .
It is not known how that idea came about .
However , Father Narciso Duran did use specific place markers for " Tamcan " and other " rancherias [ communities ] " along the San Joaquin River on his 1824 map of the native communities east of Mission San Jose .
Location The Tamcan territory along the Old River of the lower San Joaquin River was probably no more than 12 miles in circumference .
The names and locations of their specific villages were never documented .
Bennyhoff was the first anthropologist to infer their location .
He concluded that their main village was on the west bank of the San Joaquin River , east of Tracy and west of Lathrop in current San Joaquin County .
Milliken , using marriage pattern data from the Mission San Jose ecclesiastical records and clues from Father Duran 's 1824 Plano Topográfico of communities east of Mission San Jose , concluded that the Tamcan lived north of the modern town of Tracy , in the vicinity of the modern town of Byron , and on Union Island just to its east .
Language The Tamcan spoke the Delta Yokuts language .
The first Delta Yokuts vocabulary was recorded at Pleasanton , California by Alphonse Pinart in 1880 .
Pinart called the language " Tcholovones , or better Colovomnes " and wrote that it was a variant on the " Tulareños " languages spoken on the San Joaquin River and at Tulare Lake ( now known to be the Yokuts language family ) .
Pinart learned that the dialect was spoken not only by the " Colovomne " , but also by the " Jachikamne , beside the town of Stockton , Pasasamne , Nututamne , Tammukamne , Helutamne , Taniamne , Sanaiamne , Xosmitamne . "
John Wesley Powell , in his 1891 synthesis Indian Linguistic Families of America North of Mexico , did not mention the Tammukan , but did include within the Mariposan language family a northern " Cholovon division " in " a small strip of territory on the eastern bank of the San Joaquin . "
A. L. Kroeber called the native language of the San Joaquin Valley " Yokuts , " a modification of terms used by Powers and Gatchet , rather than follow Powell 's use of " Mariposan " for the language family .
In 1908 he cited the Pinart " Tcholovones " manuscript as evidence that a Yokuts language had been spoken in the San Joaquin River Delta prior to Spanish mission outreach in that area . "
M. Pinart in this paper gives a vocabulary which is pure Yokuts , " wrote Kroeber , who also repeated Pinart 's list of the local groups , including " Tammukamne , " as Pinart had spelled them .
Two years later Hodge briefly mentioned " Tammukamne " in his compendium on American Indians.The unique nature of the far northern Yokuts language spoken by Pinart 's " Colovomnes " and " Tammukamnes " was first delineated in 1959 .
Recently Golla , who has introduced the term " Delta Yokuts " for the language , wrote that Ken Whistler " has proposed that the vocabulary distinctive of some of the Delta Yokuts dialects may reflect substratal influence from pre-proto-Yokuts or from an extinct Yok-Utian language . "
Norval Smith has recently analyzed a small previously-unpublished " Tamukan " word list that supports the conclusion that the Tamcan people spoke the Delta Yokuts language .
History Tamcan individuals first appeared in the baptismal register of Mission San José in 1806 .
They were baptized there in mixed groups with their immediate neighbors , whose name was written " Cholvon " at that mission , through the year 1811 .
Occasional Tamcan individuals , intermarried with more distant groups , continued to be baptized at Mission San Jose until 1824 .
By that year 138 of them had been baptized .
Notable Tamcan descendents José Guzman , a notable early twentieth-century consultant to linguist J. P. Harrington , was partially Tamcan by descent .

" P " Is for Peril is the 16th novel in the " Alphabet " series of mystery novels by Sue Grafton .
The novel focuses on the disappearance of Dr. Dowan Purcell , a nursing home administrator and doctor at Pacific Meadows Nursing Home , and features Kinsey Millhone , a private eye based in Santa Teresa , California .
The novel is set in 1986 .
Plot summary Kinsey Millhone is hired by Fiona , the first wife of Dr. Dowan Purcell to move along the stalled investigation by police of his disappearance .
He disappeared 9 weeks earlier , on 12 September 1986 .
The first wife is more concerned than present wife Crystal .
Fiona , embittered by the breakdown of her marriage , is convinced that Dow has engineered his own disappearance , as she alleges Crystal is having an affair and admits that Dow has gone missing a couple of times before .
In support of this , his passport and thirty thousand dollars seem to be missing .
In contrast , Crystal , a former stripper Dow met on a trip to Las Vegas , is convinced he is dead .
Not impressed either with Fiona 's haughty personality or the chances of turning up something on a cold trail , Kinsey accepts the case with misgivings.She soon finds evidence that there has been fraudulent Medicare / Medicaid activity at Pacific Meadows , the care home at which Purcell worked as medical director following his retirement from general practice .
Opinion varies amongst his former colleagues and associates as to whether Purcell could have been responsible , whether deliberately or through administrative incompetence , but since he is missing , he is certainly a convenient scapegoat for any blame which might be assigned by the ongoing official investigation .
Kinsey meets an old acquaintance in the form of Dana Glaser , formerly Dana Jaffe , now married to wealthy businessman Joel Glaser , co-director of the management company which owns Pacific Meadows .
By coincidence , Kinsey 's landlord Henry adds to the evidence of fraud when sorting through the finances of Rosie 's recently deceased sister , Klothilde , who had stayed at Pacific Meadows .
Kinsey struggles to work out whether Dow has done a runner with some illegal gains , killed himself having realized he was going to be implicated , or was entirely innocent but murdered by the real perpetrator of the fraud.In a sub-plot , Kinsey has decided it is time to leave her current rented office space at Kingman and Ives , and finds her dream office space up for rental by brothers Richard and Tommy Hevener .
After snapping it up with a big advance rent payment , and starting to date the attractive Tommy , Kinsey receives a shocking visit from one Mariah Talbot , who explains that the Heveners are suspects in the murder of their parents in Texas some years before ; given Kinsey 's blossoming relationship with Tommy , she is hoping Kinsey will help her entrap the brothers .
Kinsey is in a dilemma ; ultimately Henry carries out the entrapment himself to protect Kinsey after failing to persuade her to steer clear of it .
After a dangerous showdown with the Hevener brothers , in which Richard kills Tommy with Kinsey 's gun , Kinsey finds out that she was duped by Mariah Talbot ; she is really the sister of the Heveners ' hired accomplice whom they are also suspected of murdering.Meanwhile , Kinsey has become embroiled in Purcell 's complex family , and a search for Crystal 's tearaway teen daughter Leila leads to Kinsey 's discovery of Dow 's car in a lake near Fiona 's property .

Union Pass is a high mountain pass in the Wind River Range situated in Fremont County of western Wyoming in the United States .
The pass is located on the Continental Divide between the Gros Ventre mountains on the west and the Wind River Range on the east .
A triple divide exists nearby , where water may flow to the Mississippi River , Columbia River , or Colorado River .
The pass was historically used by Native Americans and early mountain men including the Astor Expedition in 1811 on its way west .
On the return trip , fearing hostile Indian activity near Union Pass , the Astorians chose a southern route and discovered South Pass.The pass was named by U.S. Army Captain William F. Raynolds in 1860 .
Raynolds was in charge of the Raynolds Expedition which was exploring the Yellowstone region immediately prior to the Civil War .
After mountain man and guide Jim Bridger led the expedition over the pass , Raynolds gave the pass its current name.The Wyoming state highway map lists the following trails of the Union Pass area : Indian trailsJohn Colter ( 1807 ) General Phil Sheridan , President Arthur ( 1833 ) fur trappers , Captain Bonneville , Captain RaynoldsBridger , Hayden ( 1860 ) prospectorshunterssettlersLocal student JessicaRose also lives up Union with her 2 siblings2 foxes we saw while up at JessicaRose 's House Location Union Pass is located in the mountains of northwestern Wyoming .
It is at an The pass location , at an elevation of 9,210 feet ( 2,810 m ) .
It is a hub from which three Wyoming Mountain Ranges radiate .
The three separate directions -- the Wind River Range to the southeast ( Gannett Peak , 13,804 feet ( 4,207 m ) ) , the Gros Ventre Range ( Doubletop Peak , 11,720 feet ( 3,570 m ) ) to the west and the Absaroka Range to the north ( Francs Peak , 13,153 feet ( 4,009 m ) ) .
The pass is 4,000 feet ( 1,200 m ) lower than mountains around it .
This provides easy passage among the headwaters of three river systems , the Colorado , the Columbia and the Missouri.An unimproved dirt road crosses the pass , connecting U.S. Route 287 near Dubois to U.S. Route 189 in Pinedale .
Native Americans Reports from the fur trappers who first entered the mountains and those following mention the trail through the pass as being in long term us by the Shoshone , Bannack , Arapaho , Gros Ventre , Flat Head or Bitterroot Salish , Nez Perce , Crow and by even others .
The pass provide access into three river sheds .
The an east-west route ran from the east up the Wind River valley and provided a western route by the Gros Ventre or Hoback rivers to the Valley of the Snake River in Jackson 's Hole .
To go south , the traveler would follow the Green River .
The Union Pass Route was an extension of a North South Route up the Valley of the Yellowstone .
Coming up the Valley of the Thoroughfare , west of the Absaroka Mountains and south of Yellowstone Lake , the trail followed the North Fork of the Yellowstone .
Crossing over Two Ocean Pass , the trail split east and west around Terrace Mountain into the Wind River Valley at DuNoir .
From Union Pass south bound travelers could use the Green River Valley to connect east through South Pass or west toward the Snake River .
Astorians - 1811 John Colter may have been the first easterner to visit the pass in 1807 , but this is based on circumstantial evidence and is disputed by scholars .
Wilson Price Hunt , the Astorians overland to the mouth of the Columbia reported crossing Union Pass on September 15 , 1811 .
This is the first record of the pass .
The expedition guides were Edward Robinson , John Hoback and Jacob Rizner .
Their previous participation in 1809 with the Henry expedition to the source of the Missouri River and back by way of the Green River it is accepted that the three had been through Union Pass , during the year 1810 .

Ebenezer Colliery was a coal mine located at Coal Point , New South Wales , Australia.Reverend Lancelot Edward Threlkeld began mining at the south west point of Coal Point near Toronto in 1840 , after the failure of his aboriginal mission.The mine was worked by hand and the skips run on wooden rails .
The coal was loaded into vessels from a large wooden jetty .
Due to the shallow channel at Swansea the coal was taken to a coal loading and storage depot at the head of Lake Macquarie , known as Reid 's Mistake , where it was loaded upon oceangoing vessels.Threlkeld 's mine pre-dated the Australian Agricultural Company ( AA Co ) monopoly on coal mining , however Threlkeld found it difficult to attract miners , to compete against the AA Co monopoly and the Governor of New South Wales George Gipps refused to supply convicts .
Threlkeld 's estate was sold at auction to the mortagee in 1844 to repay outstanding debts.The mine was worked further under lease by Henry R. Whittell and later by Ralph M. Robey , although it was often not worked .
It was worked as South Hetton Colliery as late as 1906 .

Captain Cook Memorial Museum is in Whitby , North Yorkshire , England , 43 miles ( 69 km ) north of York .
The Museum is in Walker ’s House which belonged to Captain John Walker to whom the great explorer , Captain Cook was apprenticed in 1746 , and to which Cook returned in the winter of 1771 -- 72 after his First Voyage .
House The house is situated in Grape Lane on the harbour side .
A plaque on the wall states that the house was built in 1688 by Moses and Susannah Dring .
It is a largish building on three floors with an attic .
It is regarded as a typical example of a well-to-do ship-owner ’s house of the period .
Much is known about the furnishings of the house from an inventory of contents taken in 1754 .
The two ground floor rooms are furnished according to this inventory and decorated in the original colour .
History The property was bought in 1729 by the father of Captain John Walker , and became his home and place of business .
He was also a captain in the merchant marine and developed the family ’s shipping business .
He died in 1743 , and in his will ( Borthwick Institute , York ) , divided his ships between his sons John and Henry , but left the house to them as tenants in common .
The brothers allowed their mother to continue to live in the house .
After the deaths of his mother and brother , John Walker moved into the house by 1755 .
The house remained in the family until the mid 19th century and then was used by turns as a hospital and as a private residence until rescued in 1986 to become the Captain Cook Memorial Museum.Cook was introduced in 1746 to Captain John Walker by William Sanderson , the grocer for whom Cook had worked in Staithes , a nearby fishing village .
Walker took him on as apprentice seaman for a three-year term .
Cook served Walker first as apprentice , then as seaman and lastly as master ’s mate until he joined the Royal Navy in 1755 .
He spent most of his time at sea on Walker ’s colliers , mainly in the coal trade between the Tyne and London but including voyages to the Baltic and Dublin.The Whitby historian George Young , ‘ Life of Cook ’ 1836 , stated that during Cook ’s apprenticeship Walker retained Cook in Whitby on occasion and lodged him in the attic of the house in Grape Lane .
There should be no difficulty in accepting this account even though Walker lived elsewhere at the time .
Apprentices ’ indentures of 1735 and 1758 ( held in the Museum ) show that shipowners tended to avoid obligation to lodge apprentices in their homes , preferring to release them during the winter months to go home to their families in Whitby and the surrounding countryside .
If an apprentice was retained ashore , he would either be boarded in the town , or anywhere convenient such as the house in Grape Lane where there was space.Young also described Cook studying in the attic with the aid of candles provided by Mary Prowd , a family servant .
Like any ambitious apprentice , Cook would have studied algebra , geometry , trigonometry and navigation , probably with the help of schoolmasters paid for by the ship owners.The house was also the scene of Cook ’s only known visit to the town after 1755 .
This was in the winter of 1771 -- 72 .
Cook was staying in Great Ayton , and ‘ took horse ’ to visit his old master in Whitby .
When Cook arrived , the household was lined up to greet him , and told to behave well .
The elderly housekeeper , Mary Prowd , who had befriended Cook a quarter century before , could not restrain herself .
Flinging her arms round the great man , she cried “ Oh honey James !
How glad I is to see thee ! ”
Archaeology Investigations carried out in 2001 revealed : The foundations of a range of small buildings interpreted as outbuildings associated with the Walkers ’ shipping businessA brick floor in a herring-bone pattern lying next to the house about a metre below today ’s ground level .
A ‘ brick-floored room ’ a kitchen by its contents , was referred to in the inventory of 1754 , but its location was unknown until now.A slipway , leading down from the main building to the river , with deposits above it dating from the mid-late 18th century .
The courtyard , a metre or so above the slipway was built over it as the Walker family moved out of ship-owning into banking and insurance .
Museum The acquisition of Walker ’s House by the Cook Museum Trust enabled the Trust to establish a museum in Whitby dedicated to the celebration of the life of Captain Cook and the scientists , artists and crews who sailed with him .
The collections comprise original letters about the Voyages including correspondence of Cook , Lord Sandwich , Sir Joseph Banks and the Forsters , paintings and drawings by the artists who went with Cook to the Pacific , including Parkinson , Hodges , and Webber , artefacts from the Pacific islands and New Zealand , original maps and charts , and ship models.In 2009 a local newspaper reported that Matavai Bay Otaheite , a painting by William Hodges from the 1770s , was bought by the museum with help from several charities and trusts including The Art Fund .
The painting depicts Matavai Bay , Tahiti which Cook visited on his second voyageWelcome to Yorkshire ( formally the Yorkshire Tourist Board ) gave the museum a White Rose Award in 2005 and 2012 and it was a winner of a VisitEngland Gold Award for Excellence in 2013 .

Susan Ahn Cuddy ( Korean : 안수산 , Hanja : 安繡山 ; January 16 , 1915 -- June 24 , 2015 ) was the first female gunnery officer in the United States Navy .
She was the eldest daughter of Korean independence activist Ahn Chang-ho and Helen Ahn , the first married Korean couple to emigrate to the United States in 1902 .
She joined the Navy in 1942 and served until 1946 , reaching the rank of lieutenant .
She was the first Asian-American woman to join the U.S. Navy .
Life Early years Susan Ahn Cuddy was born in 1915 in Los Angeles , California as the eldest daughter of Dosan Ahn Changho and Helen Lee .
In 1902 , her parents were the first Korean married couple to immigrate to the United States .
The couple tirelessly worked to liberate their mother country from Japanese colonization ; Ahn Chang Ho would eventually give his life to that movement in 1938 , after succumbing to injuries from his constant imprisonment and torture by the Japanese.As the family established themselves , the Ahn house became a haven for many Korean immigrants .
The Young Korean Academy ( Hung Sa Dan ) made its headquarters at the Ahn ′ s residence as a resource center for many Korean immigrants .
Many exiled Korean patriots , including Soh Jaipil , the first Korean American citizen , visited the Ahns while they lived at 106 North Figueroa during the Japanese occupation of Korea .
The third child of five , and eldest daughter , Susan always said that her parents ’ sacrifice and dedication to the Korean independence cause would play a defining role in her own identity and values.During her youth Susan Ahn Cuddy worked for many of Dosan ′ s Independence organizations in Los Angeles .
Susan attended Beaudry Elementary , Central Junior High and Belmont High School .
She enjoyed and participated in sports such as baseball and field hockey .
When Susan was at Los Angeles City College she was in charge of Women 's Baseball as well as playing great at Second Base .
She played for the Bing Crosby Croonerettes softball team .
She had to stop playing to keep her amateur status to play college baseball .
Susan graduated from San Diego State University in 1940 and joined the United States Navy in 1942 serving until 1946 .
Career After Japan bombed Pearl Harbor , she enlisted in the United States Armed Forces and enrolled in the U.S. Naval Reserve Midshipmen 's School at Smith College in Northampton , Massachusetts .
She became the first Asian American woman in the Navy .
This was at a time when anti-Asian sentiment in the country was high and women were still battling over sexism in the military .
She told biographer John Cha , who wrote Willow Tree Shade : The Susan Ahn Cuddy Story , published in 2002 , " A lot of people thought that women did n’t belong in the service .
That made us try harder . "
She felt joining the Navy was a way to help free Korea from the harsh Japanese colonial era rule and was eager to join the Navy to fight the Japanese .
She worked her way up in the Navy , becoming a Navy LINK instructor in 1943 , teaching aviators how to maneuver in a simulator cockpit and later becoming the first female aerial gunnery officer in the Navy - in other words , she trained fighter pilots how to shoot down enemy aircraft .
She knew to work some guns men were having difficulty with .
In Willow Tree Shade , Cha described one incident where a white male pilot protested having to take directions from Susan because she was Asian and female . "
Down here , you will shoot when I tell you to shoot ! "
she told the pilot .
Susan Ahn Cuddy eventually became a Lieutenant and went on to work for US Navy Intelligence and the Library of Congress.Then , she went to work for The National Security Agency in Washington DC .
During the Cold War , she was in charge of a think tank of over 300 agents working in the Russia section .
She received a Fellowship from the National Security Agency to study at the University of Southern California in 1956 .
Susan worked on many top secret projects for the Department of Defense and other agencies during her service with the United States government until 1959 .
Even today , Mrs. Cuddy 's accomplishments are considered remarkable and are , indeed , unparalleled .
Personal life Even in her personal life , Susan proved a trailblazer .
In April 1947 Susan married Chief Petty Officer Francis X. " Frank " Cuddy an Irish-American ( deceased in 1994 ) and defied anti-miscegenation laws in place at that time and wed at the only place that would marry them : a Navy chapel in Washington , D.C. Francis also worked for Navy Intelligence and NSA .
He was a code-breaker and helped the United States free Korea through his specialty , work since he spoke Japanese fluently .
After his 33-year Navy career he worked for Kodak and GAF in film processing sales .
He helped finance the Ahn family ′ s Moongate restaurant business .
In 1959 the couple moved to Los Angeles to raise their children and also in hopes of winning her mother 's acceptance of her mixed-race marriage.The couple had two children , Philip " Flip " and Christine , and it was this new role as a mother that would cause Susan to eventually leave the intelligence community in 1959 , so she could spend more time with her children .
Returning to California , she helped her eldest brother Philip Ahn ( the pioneering Asian American actor ) and sister Soorah run their popular Chinese restaurant , Moongate , in Panorama City .
After Philip died in 1978 , Susan largely filled the role of Ahn family representative and worked hard to archive her legendary family ’s records and managed the famous Phil Ahn ′ s Moongate Restaurant in Panorama City until 1990 .
Later life In 2003 , the State Assembly of California of District 28 named Mrs. Cuddy the Woman of the Year in honor of her commitment to public service .
On October 5 , 2006 she received the American Courage Award from the Asian American Justice Center in Washington D.C.Susan Ahn Cuddy , long considered a living legend for shattering barriers for women and Asian Americans in the U.S. Navy and later as a code-breaker for the National Security Agency , died at her home in Northridge , California .
Even in her elder years , Susan remained active , speaking at Navy functions and Korean American community events , even campaigning for then-presidential candidate Barack Obama .
A breast cancer survivor , she also helped raise money for the cause .
In recent years , she was honored with numerous accolades by government bodies and nonprofits .
This past spring , the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors designated a " Susan Ahn Cuddy Day . "
Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas , who introduced the declaration , was an especially devoted fan . "
These were all firsts as an Asian American woman in a man ’s world , " he said of her accomplishments , during a March 10 ceremony . "
Anti-Asian sentiment was brazenly prevalent , but that did n’t deter Susan Ahn Cuddy -- she just knew what her mission was . "
Death and legacy Susan Ahn Cuddy died at her home in Northridge , Calif. , on Wednesday afternoon , June 24 , 2015 , said her son , Philip " Flip " Cuddy .
She was 100 years old . "
She died very peacefully in her own bed , " said Flip Cuddy . "
Right up to the very end , she was clear-headed .
But her body was just not going to support her mind . "
Her life story is also the subject of the short biography Willow Tree Shade by John Cha .

Nicolas Lupot ( 4 December 1758 -- 14 August 1824 ) was one of the most illustrious French luthiers ( violin makers ) of his time.Lupot was born in Stuttgart .
He was apprenticed to his father and worked in Orléans until 1794 .
Soon after , he moved to Paris , where he was appointed violin maker to the king ( 1815 ) , and to the Conservatoire of Paris ( 1816 ) .
This latter post involved furnishing instruments ( of the whole violin family ) awarded to first-prize winners.Lupot was ordered by King Louis XVIII to make an orchestra of stringed instruments which were to be decorated/embellished with the coat of arms of France .
He ambitiously undertook in 1820 to replace all the instruments of the royal orchestra with new ones of his own make , but death in 1824 prevented him from fulfilling this plan.He frequently received the title of " The French Stradivarius " and in Mirecourt there is a street named after him .
Modeling ( except a few after Guarnerius and Amati ) always after that of Stradivarius and he imitated that genius more minutely than anybody else had or has ever done .
This is why there is such a refreshing variety in his productions some of broad proportions , others more normal and some under the recognized full sizes as well as a few of long pattern . "
Lupot was an important French maker , modeling his instruments after Stradivari . "
Quotes " The first violin maker of the family was his grandfather Laurent Lupot ( baptised in Mirecourt , 11 August 1696 ; died in Orléans , after 1762 ) .
He worked in Plombières ( near Epinal ) about 1725 , then in Lunéville for Stanisław Leszczyński 's court from 1738 to 1756 , and finally in Orléans from 1762 until his death .
His eldest son , François ( i ) ( born in Plombières , 5 July 1725 ; died in Paris , 25 August 1805 ) , Nicolas ' father , left Lunéville to work in Germany as violin maker to the Duke of Württemberg .
He settled in Stuttgart , where Nicolas was born , then in Ludwigsburg .
In 1768 he returned to France and joined his father in Orléans , where he opened his own workshop and acquired the sobriquet François Lupot d'Orléans . " "
Although the work of Stradivari was Lupot 's guide , he was anything but a slavish copyist .
What he did grasp as well as any Stradivari follower was incomparable good taste in workmanship ; within this discipline he gave expression to his own admirable ideas , as described by Sibire ( 1806 ) .
His rich orange-red varnish , perfectly transparent , gave the final touch .
Occasionally he copied Guarneri del Gesù , whose violins were rapidly achieving fame in the first two decades of the 19th century .
Lupot 's production was almost entirely of violins ; violas and cellos are a rarity .
The aristocratic tonal qualities of his instruments have always been well appreciated by players .
Lupot 's most important pupil was Charles François Gand , who also became his successor through having married a young girl that Lupot considered as his adopted daughter .
Another was Sébastien-Philippe Bernardel .
Lupot 's influence was strongly felt in Paris throughout the 19th century ; above all , he created the standard by which the rest of the great French school is judged . "

John Phillips House is a historic 1853 vernacular Greek Revival house in the Spring Valley area of Polk County , Oregon , United States .
It was built for pioneer John Phillips , who came to Oregon via the Oregon Trail in 1845 .
He finished his journey to Oregon on the Meek Cutoff as part of Stephen Meek 's " lost wagon train " .
John Phillips , born in 1814 , was a native of Wiltshire England who came to the U.S. in 1834 and settled in Florida .
After living in New Orleans -- where he met and married Elizabeth Hibbard in 1839 -- and St. Louis , he came to Oregon and bought the Turner donation land claim in Polk County for $ 100 .
The locale was once known as Spring Valley Ranch .
John Phillips hired carpenter Samuel Coad to build a house for him there.Samuel Coad served during the Cayuse War in 1855 , and helped construct buildings at Fort Hoskins , including one commissioned by then-Lieutenant Philip Sheridan , which was moved near the community of Pedee .
Also known as the Condron House , the Philip Sheridan House has been returned to the Fort Hoskins site and is being restored .
Samuel Coad married the daughter of General Cornelius Gilliam , Henrietta , in 1853 .
Coad also constructed the woolen mill at Ellendale.As of 1980 , the John Phillips House was the oldest residence in Polk County and was still in the Phillips family .
John Phillips is buried in the Zena Cemetery at Spring Valley Presbyterian Church .

Wonder is an emotion comparable to surprise that people feel when perceiving something very rare or unexpected ( but not threatening ) .
It has historically been seen as an important aspect of human nature , specifically being linked with curiosity and the drive behind intellectual exploration .
Wonder is also often compared to the emotion of awe but awe implies fear or respect rather than joy .
History French philosopher , mathematician , scientist , and writer René Descartes ( 1596 -- 1650 ) described wonder as one of the primary emotions because he claimed that emotions in general are reactions to unexpected phenomena .
He noted that when people first encounter a surprising or new object , " ... this makes us wonder and be astonished at it " .
Descartes therefore propounded that " Wonder is the first of all the passions . "
( Descartes The Passions of the Soul Article 53 . )
But Descartes , unlike the Greek philosophers before him , held a fundamentally negative view of wonder : " Although it is good to be born with some kind of inclination to this passion [ wonder ] because it disposes us to the acquisition of sciences , yet we ought afterwards to endeavor as much as we can to be rid of it . "
( Descartes The Passions of the Soul 2 Article 76 . )
This sentiment is reflected in other early modern authors like Thomas Hobbes in his discussion about the English words Curiosity , Joy and Admiration .
Hobbes argued that since " ... whatsoever therefore happeneth new to a man , giveth him hope and matter of knowing somewhat that he knew not before " , which creates " ... hope and expectation of future knowledge from anything that happeneth new and strange " , a " passion which we commonly call ADMIRATION ; and the same considered as appetite , is called CURIOSITY , which is appetite of knowledge . "
In De Homine XII , Hobbes discussed the “ joy ” of “ admiration ” again contrasting humans to other animals .
Hobbes argues that " ... this passion is almost peculiar to men . "
He pointed out that " even if other animals , whenever they behold something new or unusual , admire it as far as they behold something new or unusual " so that they can determine if it dangerous or harmless , men on the other hand , " when they see something new , seek to know whence it came and to what use they can put it . "
In The History of Astronomy , Adam Smith dwells on wonder not to explain the difference between human and animal thinking only , but rather to explain why we study natural science .
An un-civilised person , or child , is still clearly different from other animals because “ it beats the stone that hurts it ” .
The child is concerned with finding an account of cause and effect , but it is limited in its ability to do so.But when law has established order and security , and subsistence ceases to be precarious , the curiosity of mankind is increased , and their fears are diminished .
[ ... ] Wonder , therefore , and not any expectation of advantage from its discoveries , is the first principle which prompts mankind to the study of Philosophy , of that science which pretends to lay open the concealed connections that unite the various appearance of nature ; and they pursue this study for its own sake , as an original pleasure or good in itself , without regarding its tendency to procure them the means of many other pleasures.In The Tangled Wing , Melvin Konner reviews the biologist ’s view of this pain and pleasure of learning .
He notes that " If the problem is too unfamiliar , it will evoke attention ; if it is difficult but doable , it will evoke interest , attention , and arousal and , when solved , it will evoke pleasure , often signalled by a smile . "
( p. 242 ) He says that “ wonder ” is “ the hallmark of our species and the central feature of the human spirit ” .
Concerning the special importance of wonder ( θαυμάζειν , thaumazein in Ancient Greek ) to philosophy see Plato Theaetetus 155D and Aristotle Metaphysics I.ii.982b11-24 .
For Aristotle also see Poetics IV : “ understanding [ manthanein ] gives great pleasure not only to philosophers but likewise to others too , though the latter have a smaller share in it ” .
Indeed , he says , people like looking at images because of the pleasure of contemplating [ theôrizein ] what something is through manthanein and syllogizesthai ( syllogism : a bringing together of logoi or accounts ) .
We even “ enjoy contemplating the most precise images of things whose sight is painful to us ” .

Ricardo Andrés Lagos Weber ( born February 21 , 1962 ) , son of former Chilean president Ricardo Lagos , is a politician who served as the Ministry General Secretariat of Government of Chile in the administration of former President Michelle Bachelet after having worked for Bachelet 's 2005-2006 campaign .
He is trained in law and economics , and has served the majority of his government career in economic positions .
He was also an organizer and the senior representative for Chile at the Annual Meeting of APEC held in Chile in 2004 , in addition to being one of the architects of the free trade agreements that Chile signed with the United States ( United States-Chile Free Trade Agreement ) and the European Union ( European Union Association Agreement ) as the head of the Foreign Ministry 's Department of Trade Policy .
He is a member of the Party for Democracy ( PPD ) .
As of March 2016 he is President of the Senate of Chile .
Early life Lagos Weber was born in the United States , the son of then-University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor and now former president Ricardo Lagos Escobar and ex-wife Carmen Weber Aliaga .
Due to the constant traveling caused by the exile of his father during the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet , Lagos Weber was forced to complete his studies in eight different schools , finishing his secondary education at Colegio San Agustin .
He completed his undergraduate studies at the Universidad de Chile School of Law , receiving his Bachelor of Law and Social Sciences degree in 1985 .
He continued his education at the University of Sussex in England , where he obtained a Masters in Economic Development at the Institute of Development Studies .
His postgraduate thesis was about flexibility in the labor market .
He began work on his doctorate in Economics at the University of Cambridge with a President of the Republic Scholarship ( Beca Presidente de la República ) , which he applied for in 1990 , but he returned to Chile to work in the Chilean section of the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) and did not finish the doctorate program .
Political career In 1995 , he became the Chilean representative to the APEC forum , conducting trade negotiations on economic cooperation .
That same year he was part of a diplomatic team negotiating a free trade agreement between Canada and Chile .
Lagoes Weber continued to negotiate trade agreements over the next few years .
Since the end of the 1990s , Lagos Weber served as the head of the department of Trade Policy of the World Trade Organization , under the Chilean Foreign Ministry 's General Directorate of International Economic Relations ( DIRECON ) .
In October , 1999 , Lagos Weber left his WTO job to serve a major role in the presidential campaign of his father Ricardo Lagos .
In 2000 , he traveled with President Lagos to Berlin to act as a panelist at the " Third Way " conference , speaking for Chile and his father 's administration .
He subsequently became Director of Multilateral Economic Affairs in 2002 , heading the General Directorate of International Economic Relations.Lagos Weber served as Chilean high representative for APEC during the summits of 2003 and 2004 , and was the " main organizer " of the conference when Chile hosted APEC .
To this end , he was also a Senior Official for Chile , and the president of APEC 's Senior Officials Meeting II prior to the conference .
Lagos Weber was a candidate for the congressional elections in December 2005 , but withdrew his candidacy in August based on polls that suggested that , even with a 45 % showing , he would not secure a seat under Chile 's electoral rules .
Ministership Lagos Weber was a top campaign strategist in Michelle Bachelet 's victorious 2005 presidential campaign .
In January , before her own inauguration , President-elect Bachelet sent Lagos Weber as Chile 's representative to the inauguration of Evo Morales in Bolivia , signaling an intent to improve the two countries ' strained relations .
In late January , 2006 , Lagos Weber was named Ministry General Secretariat of Government , essentially the presidential spokesman , by President Michelle Bachelet , and he took office on March 11 .
In 2007 , Bachelet announced that any cabinet members seeking to run in the upcoming elections would have to announce their resignation by January , 2008 .
With the popularity of the Bachelet administration at a low , and the Concertación 's support suffering , Lagos Weber announced his resignation on December 6 , 2007 , to make his candidacy for the Senate of Chile for the district of the Valparaíso Region in the December 2008 election .
Seen as a rising star , often aided by his recognizability as the former president 's son and a visible spokesman to the current president , the upcoming election takes on increased importance as the Concertación faces the risk of losing its dominant role in the government .
He was replaced by Francisco Vidal ( also from the PPD ) , who had already served in that post for the administration of Ricardo Lagos Escobar .
Lagos Weber is currently considered a frontrunner for the position of president of the PPD , though he has not announced his candidacy in the April election .
Senate Lagos Weber is a member of the Senate of Chile for district V Valparaíso Region .
On 15 March 2016 he was elected President of the Senate , he succeeded Patricio Walker .

The salt print was the dominant paper-based photographic process for producing positive prints during the period from 1839 through approximately 1860 .
The salted paper technique was created in 1833 by English scientist and inventor Henry Fox Talbot .
He made what he called " sensitive paper " for " photogenic drawing " by wetting a sheet of writing paper with a weak solution of ordinary table salt ( sodium chloride ) , blotting and drying it , then brushing one side with a strong solution of silver nitrate .
This produced a tenacious coating of silver chloride in an especially light-sensitive chemical condition .
The paper darkened where it was exposed to light .
When the darkening was judged to be sufficient , the exposure was ended and the result was stabilized by applying a strong solution of salt , which altered the chemical balance and made the paper only slightly sensitive to additional exposure .
In 1839 , washing with a solution of sodium thiosulfate ( " hypo " ) was found to be the most effective way to make the results truly light-fast .
The salt print process is often confused with Talbot 's slightly later calotype or " talbotype " process , in part because it was normally used when making prints from calotype paper negatives .
Calotype paper employed silver iodide instead of silver chloride , but the most important difference is that it was a developing out process , not a printing out process like the salt print , meaning that a much shorter exposure was used to produce an invisible latent image which was then chemically developed to visibility .
This made calotype paper far more practical for use in a camera .
Salted paper typically required at least an hour of exposure in the camera to yield a negative showing much more than objects silhouetted against the sky .

Gold was discovered in the Yentna Cache-Creek Mining District in the US state of Alaska ( also known separately as the Yentna District or Cache Creek District ) of the upper Susitna Valley in 1898 , soon followed by claim staking .
Placer mining was reported in the Cache Creek drainage of the Dutch Hills by 1906 .
Quaternary glaciofluvial deposits , alluvial deposits , and Cenozoic conglomeratic white quartz-breccia units have been mined in the Dutch Hills .
About 200,000 ounces ( 6.2 tonnes ) of gold has been produced from these placer deposits.By 1927 , a road from Talkeetna was constructed into the mining area , known today as The Petersville Road .
The mining camp of Petersville , Alaska served as the area Post Office for several years in the late 1920s and early 1930s .
Two areas have been set aside for recreational gold mining , the North and South units of the Petersville State Recreation Mining Areas .
Many smaller one-man and family placer mining operations continue today.In addition to placer gold mining , the district has had some mining of tungsten from scheelite deposits , and small-scale lode mining for gold.The district is well known due to the influence of artist Sydney Laurence and the still-unsolved murders of four miners in 1939 which gained nationwide attention ( see The Mystery of the Cache Creek Murders by Roberta Sheldon ) .
A steam-powered dragline was used to mine the placer deposits of Peters Creek , below the canyon that cuts through the Peters Hills .
The tailings of that operation can be seen today , and the area is part of the Petersville State Recreation Mining Area.A cluster of deposits is in the main part of the Yentna district , near the Dutch Hills .
The productive deposits here have been placer gold deposits with byproduct platinum and locally abundant cassiterite .
Gold-bearing lodes in the Yentna district , which have not been as well described , include small and locally very rich deposits associated with felsic dikes and apparently low-grade deposits in major shear and altered zones .
Assays exceeding 1 ounce of gold per ton have been obtained from three of these areas , and selected quartz-arsenopyrite vein material from one prospect assayed about 200 ounces of gold per ton .
Cache Creek Mine A bucketline dredge was constructed in Cache Creek in the 1920s , and used locally-abundant coal to fire the boilers .
Later , a hydroelectric plant was used to run the dredge .
The dredge mined the entire valley of Cache Creek as far as the mouth of Nugget Creek , then bulldozers mined what remained .
Hydraulic mining was also widely used before 1942 , and many ditches can be found all over the Dutch Hills today .
About 115,000 ounces of placer gold was reported to have been produced from Cache Creek .
An active placer mine operated in 1998-1999 .
The Blue Ribbon Mine The first reported mining in what was to become The Blue Ribbon Mine took place in 1906 .
Except for some stretches when no mining took place , some gold has probably been recovered every year since .
The total amount recovered is unknown , but at least 20,000 ounces have been reported recovered , mostly by small-scale hand or mechanized methods .
The placer mine continues operating today , and the company is actively exploring lode deposits .

Anne Clark Martindell ( July 18 , 1914 -- June 11 , 2008 ) was an American Democratic Party politician from New Jersey , as well as a diplomat who served as United States Ambassador to New Zealand from 1979 to 1981 .
Early life and family Anne Clark was born in New York City on July 18 , 1914 to William and Marjory Clark .
After attending boarding school in Maryland she enrolled at Smith College in 1932 .
After one year at Smith , she was forbidden from returning to campus by her father , William Clark , a federal judge in Newark , New Jersey who would later be appointed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit .
He forced her to withdraw from the college , fearing that an educated woman would be unmarriageable .
Much later in life she would return to Smith and earn a B.A. degree in 2002 , at the age of 87 .
Smith also honored its oldest graduate with an honorary Doctor of Laws degree.Following her departure from Smith she returned home to Princeton , New Jersey and married George Scott , a stockbroker , in 1934 .
They had three children together : Marjory Scott Luther , George C. Scott III ; and David C. Scott .
The marriage ended in divorce after 13 years .
Upon her divorce she met and later married Jackson Martindell , publisher of Marquis Who 's Who , the company that annually produces Who ’s Who in America .
Together they had a son , Roger , who served on the Princeton Borough Council .
Political career Martindell was already in her fifties when she became active in Democratic politics .
Her brother Blair Clark was the national campaign director for Eugene McCarthy in the 1968 presidential campaign .
She attended the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago to show support for McCarthy , as well as for New Jersey gubernatorial candidate Robert B. Meyner , a friend of the family .
After the convention , Meyner asked Martindell to become vice chair of the New Jersey Democratic State Committee .
At the end of her four-year appointment , local Democrats encouraged Martindell to run for New Jersey Senate in 1973 in a traditionally Republican district encompassing parts of Hunterdon , Mercer , Middlesex and Morris Counties .
She managed to beat incumbent State Sen. William E. Schluter in a year when Republicans battled the specter of the Watergate scandal and Democrats were buoyed by the landslide victory of Brendan Byrne as Governor of New Jersey.In her four years in the State Senate , Martindell worked primarily on women 's issues , education , and the environment .
She served as chair of the Education Committee , member of the Appropriations Committee , chair of the Budget Revision Subcommittee for Higher Education , chair of the Joint State Library Committee , member of the Senate Nursing Home Commission , and chair of the Committee to Defeat Casino Gambling .

She was succeeded in the Senate by Walter E. Foran , then serving in the New Jersey General Assembly , who won a special election to fill the remainder of Martindell 's term as well as the general election for a full four-year term .
Diplomatic career Martindell was first appointed to the Commission to Review Ambassadorial Appointments and later became director of the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance , surveying natural-disaster reconstruction efforts funded by USAID .

Noel stated that the song 's lyrics are about a circle of friends that he was involved with at one time in his life , as well as being semi-autobiographical .
Q Magazine stated that the song is " Easily a stand-out moment in the vast pantheon of Gallagher anthems ... [ an ] evocative heartbreak record for the disaffected middle youth who is still a vulnerable youngster at the core ... " An rare early demo of the track featured flautist Charlotte Glasson , but when the album was re-recorded the flute part was not included .
Glasson featured on Gas Panic !
from the same album.Although not released as a commercial single , the song was released as a radio-single in the United States , where the song received airplay but failed to chart due in part to no official release .

Max Wilhelm Kimmich ( also known as M. W. Kimmich ; 4 November 1893 in Ulm -- 16 January 1980 in Icking , Upper Bavaria ) was a German film director and screenwriter during the first half of the 20th century .
He was brother-in-law to Joseph Goebbels .
Early life ( 1893 -- 1933 ) He was born in Ulm in West Germany to the painter , art teacher and author Karl Kimmich and his wife Christine , née Autenrieth .
He had an older brother , also named Karl Kimmich , thirteen years his senior .
While his brother went into banking , Max Kimmich visited military academies in Karlsruhe and Berlin after passing his school leaving exams and later fought as a regular officer in World War I .
After the war , he studied medicine for a few terms , but at the beginning of the 1920s he became attracted to theatre and film , especially American films .
So he worked at the German Cinema Company , beginning as an assistant and dramatic adviser .
After that he became associate producer and later , producer , with the Rochus Gliese film company .
In 1924 , he went to Hollywood , where he worked at Universal Studios as a screenwriter and , according to himself , as director .
But as he could not really gain ground in the USA , in 1929 , he went back to Germany .
The following year , he composed the music to his first sound film Waves of Passion ( Wellen der Leidenschaft ) .
In the next few years , he edited screenplays for cloak-and-dagger films like Under False Flag ( 1931/1932 ) , The Invisible Front ( 1932 ) or On Secret Service ( 1933 ) with various partners .
During the Nazi era ( 1933 -- 1945 ) Kimmich 's career began to boom after the Nazis came to power in 1933 .
He wrote the screenplays for several adventure films - sometimes with a nationalistic touch like Hangmen , Women and Soldiers ( Henker , Frauen und Soldaten ) from 1935 - and worked for directors such as Harry Piel and Paul Wegener .
In 1938 , he made his first film as director , a crime movie that was also produced as radio drama in Breslau the following year .
In February 1938 , he married Maria Goebbels , the youngest sister of propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels .
The latter seems to have been skeptical at first because he suspected that Kimmich was not really interested in his sister , but only in the excellent connections this marriage would give him .
( Since film was an important propaganda medium for the Nazis , this was quite possible ) .
Kimmich was able to allay Goebbels ´ doubts in a private conversation in summer 1937 , and the marriage took place the following year .
He specialized in anti-British propaganda films , e.g. My Life for Ireland in 1940/1941 , and Germanin from 1942 , which portrays scientists developing a medicine against sleeping sickness .
While Nazi film magazines praised the latter - shortly after release it was awarded not only " artificially valuable " , but also " national-political valuable " by film checkers of the propaganda ministry - today it is considered to be rather weak .
Several of Kimmich 's other films gained official recommendations in these years .
His works The Fugitive of Chicago in 1933/1934 , I Sing Myself into Your Heart in 1934 , Hangmen , Women and Soldiers in 1935 , The Fox of Glenarvon in 1940 and Fourth Man Missing ( Der Vierte kommt nicht ) in 1938/1939 were recommended as " artistically valuable " .
He earned most recommendations , however , for My Life for Ireland .
This 1940/1941 movie was recommended not only " artistically and national-political valuable " , but additionally as " particularly suitable for adolescents " ( jugendwert ) .
His last film , Peanuts ( Kleinigkeiten ) , which he started in 1944 with Tobis , was not finished at the end of the war .
It has been said that while working on this movie , Kimmich was in Vienna and witnessed the invasion of the Allies , but Goebbels biographer Curt Riess states Kimmich was in Berlin and escaped from the nearly encircled town with his wife and mother-in-law on April 19 , 1945 .
Until his death ( 1945 -- 1980 ) After the German surrender , Kimmich moved to the small village of Mörlach about 15 miles from Munich with his family ( he had become a father in early 1945 ) .
There they lived under a false name for nearly a year , but in June 1946 he revealed their real identities to the American occupying forces .
After that , he , his wife and his mother-in-law were questioned by the Americans several times , claiming they did not have contact with Joseph Goebbels and had never taken any money from him .
Kimmich claimed that Joseph Goebbels - contrary to his own diary entries - seldom took care of his relatives .
This behaviour of his brother-in-law had been decisive in his denying Goebbels ´ order to stay in Berlin and commit suicide .
There is speculation , Kimmich may have been interned after that interview as there was a photo taken by an American journalist on June 25 , 1946 - two weeks after the first interview - which shows only his daughter with her mother and grandmother .
The description of the photo stated the little girl was 18 months old.The Allies banned his films My Life for Ireland , The Fox of Glenarvon ( another anti-British propaganda film ) and Germanin .
However , in the early 1950s , the ban was lifted by the German film industry which had gained independence once again .
His movie Moscow-Shanghai was shown in West German cinemas in 1949 , now called The Way to Shanghai .
During the following years , he worked as an author , produced several scripts for radio and television broadcasts and - until the late 1950s - also worked for the Deutschen Filmring ( Defir , a Munich film company ) .
Since the mid of the 1950s , he and his wife also earned money during the publication of Joseph Goebbels ´ diaries and other unpublished works by Francois Genoud ( in his last will and testament , Goebbels had named his sister as his sole heir ) .
Max Kimmich died on 16 January 1980 at the age of 86 in Icking .

The cruise ship industry is a significant and growing contributor to the United States economy , providing more than $ 32 billion in benefits annually and generating more than 330,000 U.S. jobs , but also making the environmental impacts of its activities an issue to many .
Although cruise ships represent a small fraction of the entire shipping industry worldwide , public attention to their environmental impacts comes in part from the fact that cruise ships are highly visible and in part because of the industry ’s desire to promote a positive image.Cruise ships carrying several thousand passengers and crew have been compared to “ floating cities , ” and the volume of wastes that they produce is comparably large , consisting of sewage ; wastewater from sinks , showers , and galleys ( graywater ) ; hazardous wastes ; solid waste ; oily bilge water ; ballast water ; and air pollution .
The waste streams generated by cruise ships are governed by a number of international protocols ( especially MARPOL ) and U.S. domestic laws ( including the Clean Water Act and the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships ) , regulations , and standards , but there is no single law or rule .
Some cruise ship waste streams appear to be well regulated , such as solid wastes ( garbage and plastics ) and bilge water .
But there is overlap of some areas , and there are gaps in others.In 2000 , the U.S. Congress enacted legislation restricting cruise ship discharges in U.S. navigable waters within the state of Alaska .
California , and Maine have enacted state-specific laws concerning cruise ship pollution , and a few other states have entered into voluntary agreements with industry to address management of cruise ship discharges .
Meanwhile , the cruise industry has voluntarily undertaken initiatives to improve pollution prevention , by adopting waste management guidelines and procedures and researching new technologies .
Concerns about cruise ship pollution raise issues for Congress in three broad areas : adequacy of laws and regulations , research needs , and oversight and enforcement of existing requirements .
Legislation to regulate cruise ship discharges of sewage , graywater , and bilge water nationally was introduced in the 109th Congress , but there was no further congressional action.This article describes the several types of waste streams that cruise ships may discharge and emit .
It identifies the complex body of international and domestic laws that address pollution from cruise ships .
It then describes federal and state legislative activity concerning cruise ships in Alaskan waters and activities in a few other states , as well as current industry initiatives to manage cruise ship pollution .
Background More than 46,000 commercial vessels -- tankers , bulk carriers , container ships , barges , and passenger ships -- travel the oceans and other waters of the world , carrying cargo and passengers for commerce , transport , and recreation .
Their activities are regulated and scrutinized in a number of respects by international protocols and U.S. domestic laws , including those designed to protect against discharges of pollutants that could harm marine resources , other parts of the ambient environment , and human health .
However , there are overlaps of some requirements , gaps in other areas , geographic differences in jurisdiction based on differing definitions , and questions about the adequacy of enforcement.Public attention to the environmental impacts of the maritime industry has been especially focused on the cruise industry , in part because its ships are highly visible and in part because of the industry ’s desire to promote a positive image .
It represents a relatively small fraction of the entire shipping industry worldwide .
As of January 2008 , passenger ships ( which include cruise ships and ferries ) composed about 12 % of the world shipping fleet .
The cruise industry is a significant and growing contributor to the U.S. economy , providing more than $ 32 billion in total benefits annually and generating more than 330,000 U.S. jobs , but also making the environmental impacts of its activities an issue to many .
Since 1980 , the average annual growth rate in the number of cruise passengers worldwide has been 8.4 % , and in 2005 , cruises hosted an estimated 11.5 million passengers .
Cruises are especially popular in the United States .
In 2005 , U.S. ports handled 8.6 million cruise embarcations ( 75 % of global passengers ) , 6.3 % more than in 2004 .
The worldwide cruise ship fleet consists of more than 230 ships , and the majority are foreign-flagged , with Liberia and Panama being the most popular flag countries .
Foreign-flag cruise vessels owned by six companies account for nearly 95 % of passenger ships operating in U.S. waters .
Each year , the industry adds new ships to the total fleet , vessels that are bigger , more elaborate and luxurious , and that carry larger numbers of passengers and crew .
Over the past two decades , the average ship size has been increasing at the rate of roughly 90 feet ( 27 m ) every five years .
The average ship entering the market from 2008 to 2011 will be more than 1,050 feet ( 320 m ) long and will weigh more than 130,000 tons.To the cruise ship industry , a key issue is demonstrating to the public that cruising is safe and healthy for passengers and the tourist communities that are visited by their ships .
Cruise ships carrying several thousand passengers and crew have been compared to “ floating cities , ” in part because the volume of wastes produced and requiring disposal is greater than that of many small cities on land .
During a typical one-week voyage , a large cruise ship ( with 3,000 passengers and crew ) is estimated to generate 210,000 US gallons ( 790,000 L ) of sewage ; 1 million US gallons ( 3,800 m3 ) of graywater ( wastewater from sinks , showers , and laundries ) ; more than 130 US gallons ( 490 L ) of hazardous wastes ; 8 tons of solid waste ; and 25,000 US gallons ( 95 m3 ) of oily bilge water .
Passengers can , singlehandedl , produce up to 7.7 pounds of waste in a single day aboard a cruise ship .
Those wastes , if not properly treated and disposed of , can pose risks to human health , welfare , and the environment .
Environmental advocates have raised concerns about the adequacy of existing laws for managing these wastes , and suggest that enforcement of existing laws is weak.A 2000 Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) report focused attention on problems of cruise vessel compliance with environmental requirements .
GAO found that between 1993 and 1998 , foreign-flag cruise ships were involved in 87 confirmed illegal discharge cases in U.S. waters .
A few of the cases included multiple illegal discharge incidents occurring over the six-year period .
GAO reviewed three major waste streams ( solids , hazardous chemicals , and oily bilge water ) and concluded that 83 % of the cases involved discharges of oil or oil-based products , the volumes of which ranged from a few drops to hundreds of gallons .
The balance of the cases involved discharges of plastic or garbage .
GAO judged that 72 % of the illegal discharges were accidental , 15 % were intentional , and 13 % could not be determined .
The 87 cruise ship cases represented 4 % of the 2,400 illegal discharge cases by foreign-flag ships ( including tankers , cargo ships and other commercial vessels , as well as cruise ships ) confirmed during the six years studied by GAO .
Although cruise ships operating in U.S. waters have been involved in a relatively small number of pollution cases , GAO said , several have been widely publicized and have led to criminal prosecutions and multimillion-dollar fines.In 2000 , a coalition of 53 environmental advocacy groups petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) to take regulatory action to address pollution by cruise ships .
The petition called for an investigation of wastewater , oil , and solid waste discharges from cruise ships .
In response , EPA agreed to study cruise ship discharges and waste management approaches .
As part of that effort , EPA issued a background document in 2000 with preliminary information and recommendations for further assessment through data collection and public information hearings .
The agency released its final Cruise Ship Discharge Assessment Report in 2009 .
The report summarized findings of recent data collection activities , especially from cruise ships operating in Alaskan waters.Concurrently , litigation regarding the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ( NPDES ) permit program led to a 2008 decision by the Ninth Circuit Court , ruling that EPA could not exclude vessel discharges from NPDES requirements .
Subsequently EPA issued an initial Vessel General Permit ( VGP ) with an effective date of February 6 , 2009 .
Cruise ship waste streams Cruise ships generate a number of waste streams that can result in discharges to the marine environment , including sewage , graywater , hazardous wastes , oily bilge water , ballast water , and solid waste .
They also emit air pollutants to the air and water .
These wastes , if not properly treated and disposed of , can be a significant source of pathogens , nutrients , and toxic substances with the potential to threaten human health and damage aquatic life .
Cruise ships represent a small -- although highly visible -- portion of the entire international shipping industry , and the waste streams described here are not unique to cruise ships .
However , particular types of wastes , such as sewage , graywater , and solid waste , may be of greater concern for cruise ships relative to other seagoing vessels , because of the large numbers of passengers and crew that cruise ships carry and the large volumes of wastes that they produce .
Further , because cruise ships tend to concentrate their activities in specific coastal areas and visit the same ports repeatedly ( especially Florida , California , New York City , Galveston , Seattle , and the waters of Alaska ) , their cumulative impact on a local scale could be significant , as can impacts of individual large-volume releases ( either accidental or intentional ) .
International laws and regulations MARPOL 73/78 is one of the most important treaties regulating pollution from ships .
Six Annexes of the Convention cover the various sources of pollution from ships and provide an overarching framework for international objectives .
In the U.S. , the Convention is implemented through the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships .
Under the provisions of the Convention , the United States can take direct enforcement action under U.S. laws against foreign-flagged ships when pollution discharge incidents occur within U.S. jurisdiction .
When incidents occur outside U.S. jurisdiction or jurisdiction can not be determined , the United States refers cases to flag states , in accordance with MARPOL .
These procedures require substantial coordination between the Coast Guard , the State Department , and other flag states , and the response rate from flag states has been poor .
Federal laws and regulations In the United States , several federal agencies have some jurisdiction over cruise ships in U.S. waters , but no one agency is responsible for or coordinates all of the relevant government functions .
The U.S. Coast Guard and EPA have principal regulatory and standard-setting responsibilities.Cruise ships that are 79 feet ( 24 m ) in length or greater , are subject to the requirements of the EPA Vessel General Permit ( VGP ) .
The most recent VGP was published in 2013 .
EPA issued a separate permit for smaller cruise ships , however this permit currently only applies to ballast water .
A Congressionally-imposed moratorium applies to other wastestreams for these vessels until December 18 , 2017 .
The Department of Justice prosecutes violations of federal laws .
In addition , the Department of State represents the United States at meetings of the IMO and in international treaty negotiations and is responsible for pursuing foreign-flag violations .
Other federal agencies have limited roles and responsibilities .
For example , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA , Department of Commerce ) works with the Coast Guard and EPA to report on the effects of marine debris .
The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service ( APHIS ) is responsible for ensuring quarantine inspection and disposal of food-contaminated garbage ( these APHIS responsibilities are part of the Department of Homeland Security ) .
In some cases , states and localities have responsibilities as well .
Sewage Commercial vessels are required to obtain NPDES permits pursuant to Section 402 of the Clean Water Act .
Section 312 of the Act prohibits the dumping of untreated or inadequately treated sewage from vessels into the navigable waters of the United States ( defined in the act as within 3 miles ( 4.8 km ) of shore ) .
Cruise ships are subject to this prohibition .
Commercial and recreational vessels with installed toilets are required to have marine sanitation devices , which are designed to prevent the discharge of untreated sewage .
Beyond 3 miles ( 4.8 km ) , raw sewage can be discharged .
On some cruise ships , especially many of those that travel in Alaskan waters , sewage is treated using Advanced Wastewater Treatment ( AWT ) systems that generally provide improved screening , treatment , disinfection , and sludge processing as compared with traditional MSDs .
AWTs are believed to be very effective in removing pathogens , oxygen-demanding substances , suspended solids , oil and grease , and particulate metals from sewage , but only moderately effective in removing dissolved metals and nutrients ( ammonia , nitrogen and phosphorus ) .
States may also establish no-discharge zones ( NDZs ) for vessel sewage , under section 312 .
A state may completely prohibit the discharge of both treated and untreated sewage from all vessels with installed toilets into some or all waters over which it has jurisdiction ( up to 3 miles ( 4.8 km ) from land ) .
As of 2017 , this designation has been used for 72 areas representing part or all of the waters of 26 states , including a number of inland states .
Greywater Graywater discharges from large cruise ships are regulated by the 2013 VGP .
Graywater discharges from small cruise ships are currently exempt from the EPA Small Vessel General Permit ( " sVGP " ) , due to the Congressional moratorium.Pursuant to a state law in Alaska , greywater must be treated prior to discharge into that state ’s waters .
Solid waste Cruise ship discharges of solid waste are governed by two laws .
Title I of the Marine Protection , Research and Sanctuaries Act makes it illegal to transport garbage from the United States for the purpose of dumping it into ocean waters without a permit or to dump material from outside the U.S. into U.S. waters .
Beyond U.S. waters , no MPRSA permit is required for a cruise ship to discharge solid waste .
The routine discharge of effluent incidental to the propulsion of vessels is explicitly exempted from the definition of dumping in the MPRSA .28 The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships prohibits the discharge of all garbage within 3 nautical miles ( 5.6 km ) of shore , certain types of garbage within 12 nautical miles ( 22 km ) offshore , and plastic anywhere .
It applies to all vessels operating in U.S. navigable waters and the Exclusive Economic Zone ( EEZ ) .
Hazardous waste The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ( RCRA ) is the primary federal law that governs hazardous waste management .
The owner or operator of a cruise ship may be a generator and/or a transporter of hazardous waste , and thus subject to RCRA rules .
Issues that the cruise ship industry may face relating to RCRA include ensuring that hazardous waste is identified at the point at which it is considered generated ; ensuring that parties are properly identified as generators , storers , treaters , or disposers ; and determining the applicability of RCRA requirements to each .
Hazardous waste generated onboard cruise ships are stored onboard until the wastes can be offloaded for recycling or disposal in accordance with RCRA.A range of activities on board cruise ships generate hazardous wastes and toxic substances that would ordinarily be presumed to be subject to RCRA .
Cruise ships are potentially subject to RCRA requirements to the extent that chemicals used for operations such as ship maintenance and passenger services result in the generation of hazardous wastes .
However , it is not entirely clear what regulations apply to the management and disposal of these wastes .
RCRA rules that cover small-quantity generators ( those that generate more than 100 kilograms but less than 1,000 kilograms of hazardous waste per month ) are less stringent than those for large-quantity generators ( generating more than 1,000 kilograms per month ) , and it is unclear whether cruise ships are classified as large or small generators of hazardous waste .
Moreover , some cruise companies argue that they generate less than 100 kilograms per month and therefore should be classified in a third category , as “ conditionally exempt small-quantity generators , ” a categorization that allows for less rigorous requirements for notification , recordkeeping , and the like.In addition to RCRA , hazardous waste discharges from cruise ships are subject to Section 311 of the Clean Water Act , which prohibits the discharge of hazardous substances in harmful quantities into or upon the navigable waters of the United States , adjoining shorelines , or into or upon the waters of the contiguous zone .
Bilge water Section 311 of the Clean Water Act , as amended by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 , applies to cruise ships and prohibits discharge of oil or hazardous substances in harmful quantities into or upon U.S. navigable waters , or into or upon the waters of the contiguous zone , or which may affect natural resources in the U.S. EEZ ( extending 200 miles ( 320 km ) offshore ) .
Coast Guard regulations prohibit discharge of oil within 12 miles ( 19 km ) from shore , unless passed through a 15-ppm oil water separator , and unless the discharge does not cause a visible sheen .
Beyond 12 miles ( 19 km ) , oil or oily mixtures can be discharged while a vessel is proceeding en route and if the oil content without dilution is less than 100 ppm .
Vessels are required to maintain an Oil Record Book to record disposal of oily residues and discharges overboard or disposal of bilge water.In addition to Section 311 requirements , the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships ( APPS ) implements MARPOL Annex I concerning oil pollution .
APPS applies to all U.S. flagged ships anywhere in the world and to all foreign flagged vessels operating in the navigable waters of the United States , or while at a port under U.S. jurisdiction .
To implement APPS , the Coast Guard has promulgated regulations prohibiting the discharge of oil or oily mixtures into the sea within 12 nautical miles ( 22 km ) of the nearest land , except under limited conditions .
However , because most cruise lines are foreign registered and because APPS only applies to foreign ships within U.S. navigable waters , the APPS regulations have limited applicability to cruise ship operations .
In addition , most cruise lines have adopted policies that restrict discharges of machinery space waste within three miles ( 5 km ) from shore .
Cruise Ship Efforts to Reduce Pollution After the intervention of the GAO , or Government Accountability Office , from 2003 to 2008 , twelve cruise ship companies who violated pollution regulations implemented new environmental strategies .
Several cruise lines within this group and others who have not been found guilty of previous violations have sought to ameliorate their pollution of marine waters .
Some of these have reduced their waste production by transferring over from single use plastic packaging to reusable plastic containers for food being prepared on board and cutlery being used on the pool decks .
Princess Cruises as well as the Royal Caribbean Cruise Line are two cruise lines that have acknowledged the waste problem , and have adopted reusable items to work towards a resolution.Recycling programs have also been implemented , and , because of the use of compactors on ships , plastics and aluminums are condensed and made easily recyclable upon ships return to port .
The United States , alone , gains upward of 18,000 pounds of recycled goods from these practices .
Some cruise lines have also taken it upon themselves to reduce air pollution , by using alternative , cleaner energy sources which has positive implications for marine waters as well .
Battery power , fuel cells , and liquified natural gas are two such sources that are being explored .
Carnival Corporation is one example of a cruise liner that is currently pursuing cleaner energies .
The company has agreed to partner with Shell and utilize liquefied natural gas , LNG , to power their next two ships .
Liquefied natural gas , although still a fossil fuel , is a much cleaner source of energy than oil and also much less expensive to the benefit of cruise companies .
Transitioning away from oil will help cruise liners combat their problems with bilge pollution .
Cruise ships efforts to reduce their waste , recycle , and find more renewable energies will help alleviate their current rate of pollution of marine waters .

The eastern hoolock gibbon ( Hoolock leuconedys ) is a primate from the gibbon family , Hylobatidae .
It is one of three species of hoolock gibbon .
This species is found in extreme eastern corner of Assam and parts of Arunachal Pradesh , Myanmar east of the Chindwin River , such as the Mahamyaing Wildlife Sanctuary , and in south west Yunnan of China .
The other hoolock gibbon , the western hoolock ( H. hoolock ) , occurs farther to the west .
Indian records for the eastern species may actually represent the western hoolock .
Classification Mootnick and Groves stated that hoolock gibbons do not belong in the genus Bunopithecus , and placed them in a new genus , Hoolock .
This genus was argued to contain two distinct species which were previously thought to be subspecies : Hoolock hoolock and Hoolock leuconedys .
The ranges of the two species are unclear and may overlap , and intermediates may occur .
Habitat and Ecology The eastern gibbon is a forest dwelling primate and prefers a continuous canopy , which makes them vulnerable to loss of habitat and can be found in deciduous or evergreen forests .
They also reside in partially deciduous hill forests as well as broadleaf pine forests and can be found as high as 2,700 m in elevation in northeastern Myanmar .
The gibbon has been found in tropical environments that experience monsoon rains and have cool , dry winters as well as lowland tropical environments.The gibbon is an omnivorous animal with fruits making up the majority of its diet at about 65 % with 60 % of the fruits being figs .
They will also consume lichen , invertebrates , bird eggs , plant parts ( buds , shoots , leaves ) , insects , and flowers .
The majority of what they will eat depends on their location and the density of the available resources , but fruits always show to be the most dominant food type this species prefers .
Gibbon groups sleep in trees that are close to each other , focusing on the tallest canopy trees , and tend to choose areas that are located either on hilltops or slopes .
They will also sleep in a fetal position with their arms hugging their knees into their chests .
The gibbons are more active in the summer months , awaking earlier in the day than in the winter months , and socialize more with each other while being awake for about 8 -- 10 hours a day , sleeping shortly before dusk arrives .
They will have food competition with Malayan giant squirrels and will chase them away from their food resources but are subject to attacks by thrushes , magpies , and drongos with the drongos being the most aggressive over food .
Threats The primary threat facing this species is habitat loss and degradation due to human activities such as logging , mining , construction , and agriculture .
They have also suffered the effects of being harvested for meat by ethnic groups in India and for use in folk medicine .
In Myanmar , the major threat stems from the effects of commercial logging and are subject to competition with humans for resources within the Hukaung Valley Tiger Reserve .
Infant gibbons have been known to have been preyed upon by monitor lizards ( Varanus ) as well as Mountain Hawk Eagles ( Nisaetus nipalensis ) , and larger gibbons have been killed by domestic dogs from local villages while crossing gaps between forests .
They are also subject to predation by leopards , pythons , and vultures .
Conservation Efforts So far , China has created the Gaoligongshan and Tongbiguan National Nature Reserves that currently house small populations of the eastern hoolock gibbon , and the Mahamyaing Sanctuary in Myanmar also acts as a gibbon shelter as well as the Hukaung Valley Tiger Reserve , which has noted that some gibbons live within its boundaries .
Within Arunachal Pradesh , the Forest Department has been working with the Wildlife Trust of India ( WTI ) to transfer gibbon groups to the Mehao Wildlife Sanctuary , and the Biological Park of Itanagar has created a program to captive-breed this species and release them into the wild with the collaboration of the Central Zoo Authority .
India has also made it illegal to kill or capture the hoolock gibbon , but they have little resources to be able to enforce the laws and are more focused on protecting larger mammals .

A vacuum Rabi oscillation is a damped oscillation of an initially excited atom coupled to an electromagnetic resonator or cavity in which the atom alternately emits photon ( s ) into a single-mode electromagnetic cavity and reabsorbs them .
The atom interacts with a single-mode field confined to a limited volume V in an optical cavity .
Spontaneous emission results as a consequence of coupling between the atom and the vacuum fluctuations of the cavity field .
The vacuum Rabi frequency is given by ω = 2 ℏ E f ( R ) ⟨ p ⋅ ϵ ⟩ .
{ \ displaystyle \ omega ={ \ frac { 2 } { \ hbar } } { \ mathcal { E } } f ( \ mathbf { R } ) \ langle \ mathbf { p \ cdot \ epsilon } \ rangle \ . }
where R is the location of the atom , f ( R ) = exp ( i k.R ) for plane-wave fields , ε is the field polarization , E { \ displaystyle { \ mathcal { E } } } = [ ħ ωk / ( 2 ε0 V ) ] 1/2 is the electric field per photon , and < p.ε > is the dipole matrix element .

His father operated the general store , which is now an antique store .
The 1844 brick house where Stong was born is located adjacent to the store and is now a private residence .
He attended Drake University in Des Moines , Iowa.Stong scored his first success in 1932 with the publication of his famous novel , State Fair , which was later adapted for the screen as the hit Rodgers and Hammerstein musical of the same name .
In addition to his novels , his short stories were published in most of the leading national magazines of the time , and he wrote several screenplays.About his writing career , he once said , " Fell while trying to clamber out of a low bathtub at the age of two .
Became a writer .
No other possible career . "

It was considered by Robert Silverberg ( in the foreword to Best of the Best : 20 Years of the Year 's Best Science Fiction ) to be the first anthology of science-fiction .
Compiling stories from 1930s pulp magazines , along with what Stong called " Scientifiction " it also contained works of horror and fantasy .
The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction describes it as " about half sf and half horror " and observes that for science fiction the pulp magazines were a new source of material for hardcover reissue.Stong published more than forty books .
He died at his home in Washington , Connecticut , in 1957 .
Stong is buried at Oak Lawn Cemetery in Keosauqua.Asked in 1951 to comment on humanism , Stong responded : " I ’ve never gone deeply enough into any of the various definitions of “ humanism ” to be able to make any intelligent or instructive comment on the subject .
When I read any of these tenuous expositions , they remind me ( a ) of the blind men and the elephant and ( b ) that I ’d better have a glass of beer and get to bed .
I do n’t see how you distinguish between the humanism of More and that of Dewey or of Aristophanes or Lackland or Chaucer or Bunyan or Saintsbury or Taine .
The boys that practice it seem to me tremendously more effective than the ones who preach it from the varied pulpits . "
Stong died April 26 , 1957 , in Washington , Connecticut .

William Cooper ( 1761 -- 1840 ) was an English teacher , businessman and entrepreneur , and political officeholder in Upper Canada ; he developed mills and other industries along the Humber River in present-day Ontario and a wharf in York .
Prior to 1838 , the former name of the Village of Lambton Mills ( now within Toronto ) was Cooper 's Mill , named in his honour in 1806 .
Cooper was born in Bath , England .
He started work as a teacher and immigrated at the age of 22 with his wife Ann to Upper Canada in 1793 .
In this early period after the American War of Independence , it was still largely frontier .
They had one son and three daughters .
Cooper started what was probably the first school in Toronto in 1798 .
He petitioned the government for more land to support this occupation and began to buy land on speculation.He moved with his family to Yonge Street north of the then Town of York , Upper Canada in 1800 .
There he was appointed by the provincial government as an auctioneer and the coroner of the Home District , serving in the latter position until 1834 .
In 1801 he gave up teaching and opened Cooper ’s Toronto Coffee House , an inn that became a social centre.Cooper and his family moved to the Lambton area in 1806 , where he established mills ( grist-mill , sawmill , fulling-mill ) .
To encourage development , the government provided machinery for his first mill , on condition that he pay for it or replace it after 18 months .
From this Cooper built what is described as the " first milling empire on the Humber . "
His mills provided basic services for the growing community : grinding its grains , processing lumber for building , and processing woolen cloth.Cooper founded more businesses in the area : a distillery , cooperage , tannery , blacksmith 's shop , store , and tavern .
Through his complex of businesses , he owned a total of hundreds of acres on the Humber waterfront , including workers ' housing for those who labored in his mills .
He got involved in port operations in York , applying for land in 1815 and completing his wharf in 1817 , the year the first steamboat operated on Lake Ontario.Cooper sold his mills in 1827 to his son Thomas , and sold much of his waterfront property a year later .
Cooper continued his other business at York as forwarder , commission merchant , and wharfinger until 1830 , being closely involved with shipping and the port activities .
That year he sold his wharf to Alexander Murray and James Newbigging.After his wife Ann died , in 1829 Cooper married a second time , to Isabella Watson .
They had one son together .
Cooper died in 1840 .

The Kindlifresserbrunnen ( German for Child Eater Fountain ) is a fountain at the Kornhausplatz ( Granary Place ) in Bern , Switzerland .
It is one of the Old City of Bern 's fountains from the 16th century.It was created in 1545/46 by Hans Gieng in place of a wooden fountain from the 15th century .
The new fountain 's original name was Platzbrunnen ( Plaza Fountain ) ; the current name was used first in 1666 .
Kindli is a Swiss German diminutive for the German word Kind , meaning child .
A literal translation of the name Kindlifresserbrunnen therefore would be " Fountain of the Eater of Little Children " .
The fountain sculpture is a sitting ogre devouring a naked child .
Placed at his side is a bag containing more children .
Because the ogre is wearing a pointed hat resembling a Jewish hat , it has been speculated about the possibility of the ogre being the depiction of a Jew as an expression of blood libel against Jews .
Another theory is that the statue is the likeness of Krampus , the beast-like creature from the folklore of Alpine countries thought to punish children during the Christmas season who had misbehaved .
According to other theories it is a depiction of the Greek god Cronus eating his children or the Roman Saturn eating the months , though Cronus should have six and Saturn twelve rather than the sculpture 's eight .
It may also represent a warning to children to avoid falling into the , at that time , nearby Bear Pits .
Another theory is that it represented Cardinal Schiner who led the Swiss Confederation into several bloody defeats in northern Italy .
An alternative theory is that it is a depiction of the older brother of Duke Berchtold ( founder of Bern ) who it is claimed , was so incensed by his younger brother 's overshadowing of him that he collected and ate the town 's children but such an incident is not recorded in Bern 's history books .
A final theory is that it is just a carnival character intended to frighten disobedient children.Around the fountain 's base runs a frieze showing armed bears going to war , including a piper and a drummer .
The frieze may have been designed by Hans Rudolf Manuel Deutsch.The Kindlifresserbrunnen is an important object in the novel L'ogre ( The Ogre ) by Jacques Chessex .

Oliver Twist is a 1982 made-for-TV adaptation of the Charles Dickens classic of the same name , premiering on the CBS television network as part of the Hallmark Hall of Fame .
Stars include George C. Scott , Tim Curry , Cherie Lunghi , and introducing Richard Charles as Oliver , in his first major film role .
Plot The film opens with a young , blonde-haired woman outdoors during a rainstorm .
She is seen struggling on her knees , and she manages to stumble into a home .
The occupants , learning that the pregnant woman is about to go into labour , make preparations for her birth.With some difficulty , the unnamed woman gives birth to a baby boy ( played by Joseph Shiner ) , with the assistance of a midwife , known as Mrs. Corney ( Anne Tirard ) .
The woman , barely able to speak , asks to see her son .
When he is given to her , she smiles weakly at him and kisses the baby 's forehead before she collapses and dies .
Witnessing the woman 's birth is Mr. Bumble ( Timothy West ) , a hard-nosed man in charge of the local orphans workhouse .
With no information on the mother 's identity , he gives the boy the name Oliver Twist.Like the other boys in the workhouse , Oliver lives a hard life of endless labour and schooling , with only a bowl of gruel for supper , while Bumble and Corney sits above them feasting on food such as leg of lamb .
After seeing his half-starved friend Dick devour his bowl and still wanting more , Oliver , in a gesture of compassion , offers the lad his own , then goes up to Bumble and asks for more , unaware of the consequences .
His request angers Bumble , who hires him out to work for Mr Sowerberry , a local undertaker.Sowerberry exploits Oliver 's pathetic features by using him as a silent mourner , present at burials for the dead who are without family or friends , many of them children .
Oliver 's situation is not much different than the workhouse , as he is given a workbench to sleep on and scraps that Sowerberry 's dogs refuse to eat for food .
Oliver also becomes the object of Noah Claypole 's ( Philip Davis ) hatred.Claypole , a teenager , has been assigned to supervise Oliver .
He gives Oliver harsh tasks and becomes further resentful when Sowerberry decides to use Oliver instead of him for silent mourner duties .
Claypole taunts Oliver one day , making fun of his dead mother .
The insulting remark angers Oliver , who delivers a surprisingly powerful blow to Claypole 's face , breaking his nose.Sowerberry rushes in and after learning what caused the fracas , takes Claypole 's side and tells Oliver he will be returned to the workhouse the following day .
Unwilling to return to the workhouse , Oliver waits until later that evening and then sneaks out .
He roams the streets that evening until he arrives in the market town of Barnet ( near London ) , where he is met by the Artful Dodger ( Martin Tempest ) .
Aware of Oliver 's plight as he too is an orphan , the Artful Dodger offers Oliver lodgings from his benefactor .
Oliver agrees , unaware of what he has got himself into.Oliver is now part of a band of thieves , overseen by Fagin ( George C. Scott ) , a kindly Jewish man of dark features .
Among Fagin 's group are Bill Sikes ( Tim Curry ) , a drunk who oversees the orphan thieves , and Nancy , an attractive young woman often used for sexual favors , and frequently abused by Bill .
She takes a liking to Oliver and tries to help him , but for this , she is eventually viciously murdered by Bill.Oliver is made aware of his true purpose with Fagin when he is expected to work as a pickpocket .
Sikes forces Oliver to help him burglarize a home in the countryside .
The boy is shot in the process .
An elderly man , Mr Brownlow , along with his niece Rose Maylie and housekeeper , Mrs. Bedwin , take pity upon him and nurse the boy back to health .
He finds both a newly found happiness and joy with them .
Mr. Brownlow and Mrs. Bedwin notice a close resemblance between Oliver and a lady 's portrait on the wall , leading them to eventually discovering the boy 's true identity.Throughout all of this is the obsession of one man bent on destroying Oliver and his reputation , even going so far as to try to have him murdered .
Monks ( Oliver Cotton ) , who has a distinguishing red birthmark over his right eye , has learned that although he and Oliver are born of different mothers , they are of the same father .
Monks learns that their father has disinherited him in favor of Oliver , though he inherited what should have been Oliver 's inheritance after his mother 's death .
Though Monks is legitimate , he also has aspirations of wealth and stature that his inheritance would provide .
Thus , he also sees the relationship between them as socially scandalous .
His efforts prove unsuccessful in the end , however.When Nancy 's body is discovered , an angry mob descends upon the gang and captures Fagin . "
Filthy Jew ! "
shouts one man who strikes him in the face .
Fagin rails against the crowd as he is led away . "
If you need money , I am the clever Jew !
If you need my help I am the kind Jew !
You all sicken me ! "
Bill , fleeing after Nancy 's murder , tries to kill his pet dog , but the dog escapes and leads the mob straight to Bill , who accidentally hangs himself after trying to flee over a rooftop and hallucinating that he sees Nancy 's bloody ghost.Brownlow is revealed to be a friend of Oliver 's father , Philip ( " Edwin " in the novel ) .
Monks ' real name is revealed to be Edward Leeford , and Philip 's marriage to Edward ' mother had been an unhappy one .
Having separated from her , Philip moved to the country where he met and fell in love with Oliver 's mother , revealed to have been named Agnes Fleming .
Leeford never told Agnes of his marriage , nor did she tell him when she became pregnant with his child ( Oliver ) .
He left for London to ask Edward 's mother for a divorce so he could marry Agnes , but died before he could do so .
Already having had a premonition that he was going to die , Leeford wrote a will in which he left a small inheritance to Edward and his mother , but the rest to Agnes .
Feeling abandoned and ashamed , Agnes ran away and disappeared , leading up to the events at the beginning of the film .
Before he went to London , Leeford left both the will and a portrait he had painted of Agnes with Brownlow.Brownlow does some investigative work on his own to bring justice to his friend 's young son .
He learns of the cruelty and inhumane conditions at the workhouse , and also learns of Bumble 's theft of workhouse funds for his own benefit , money which has been intended to properly feed and clothe the orphans .
Bumble immediately blames his wife , Mrs. Mann ( to whom he proposed marriage at the start of the film ) for the misappropriations and claims to love Oliver as he does the other orphans .
After receiving a locket Mrs. Bumble had stolen from Agnes 's corpse and revealing to everyone the boy 's true identity , Brownlow tells Monks that he will be going to prison .
Then , not fooled by Bumble 's charade , Brownlow informs him that under British law , a husband is accountable for his wife 's misdeeds , prompting Bumble 's famous reply " If that 's the eye of the law , then the law is a ass . "
Brownlow then tells Bumble that he will use his influence to see to it that he and his wife lose their workhouse jobs and may even face criminal charges.The film ends with Monks going to prison and Brownlow and Rose assuring Oliver that he is no longer a foundling , but now has a true identity of his own .
Everyone then climbs into Brownlow 's coach and they make the journey back to Brownlow 's estate .

" F " Is for Fugitive is the sixth novel in Sue Grafton 's " Alphabet " series of mystery novels and features Kinsey Millhone , a private eye based in Santa Teresa , California .
Plot summary Henry Pitts is having Kinsey 's garage apartment rebuilt after it was destroyed .
Royce Fowler wants the detective to exonerate his son of the murder of Jean Timberlake , seventeen years before , in Floral Beach , California .
Bailey Fowler pleaded guilty to killing Jean , his sometime girlfriend , and escaped from prison soon afterwards .
He has apparently been living the life of a model citizen under an assumed name .
He is recaptured and is claiming his innocence .
Kinsey heads to Floral Beach , a tiny local community , to pursue the cold trail , and stays with the Fowler family at their motel .
Royce is dying of cancer , his wife Oribelle is sick with diabetes and their daughter , Ann , Bailey 's senior by five years , has taken leave of absence from her job as a counselor at the local high school to provide care for her parents.Bailey 's lawyer , Jack Clemson , fills her in on the details of the case : Jean , 17 when she died , was a problem child who was doing badly at school and engaged in numerous sexual encounters with the local boys at school - and some of the local men too .
She was pregnant at the time of her death .
Everyone knows everyone in Floral Beach and Kinsey acquaints herself with a number of the locals in pursuit of the truth : Pearl , the local bar-owner , whose son 's evidence put Bailey on the spot at the time of Jean 's death ; Tap Granger , who was Bailey 's accomplice in several robberies before the murder ; the local pastor Reverend Haws and his wife ; and Dr. Dunne , whose wife Elva has a violent objection to being questioned .
The high school principal at the time of the murder , Dwight Shales , offers some help .
Jean 's single mother , Shana , whose friendship with Dwight is causing raised eyebrows around Floral Beach .
She is struggling with longstanding alcohol problems , is less co-operative , and refuses to identify Jean 's father .
Nobody seems convinced that the killer could be anyone but Bailey.At Bailey 's arraignment , Tap Granger stages a hold-up , allowing Bailey to escape once more .
Tap is himself killed in the escape .
Kinsey gets confirmation from Tap 's widow that Tap was paid to do it - for the first time providing concrete evidence that someone wants to keep Bailey discredited .
Someone breaks into Kinsey 's motel room at the motel , and she receives threatening calls in the middle of the night as she pursues the case .
Oribelle is murdered when her insulin is adulterated , which medication is administered regularly by Ann.Kinsey establishes that Dr Dunne is Jean 's unknown father .
Shana is murdered when she sets out to keep a rendezvous with him .
Kinsey runs from the cops herself after she finds the body , and seeks refuge with Dwight Shales , who confesses that he , too , was having an affair with Jean , and was probably the father of her child .
Kinsey realizes that Ann Fowler is jealous of anyone who comes into contact with Dwight.She searches Ann 's room , and finds evidence that Ann supplied Tap with the hold-up gun and made the anonymous phone calls .
Unfortunately , she also finds Ann waiting for her , armed with a shotgun .
Jean had confided in her , as school counselor , that Dwight was the father of her child .
Motivated by jealousy , Ann killed her , and being equally jealous of her brother 's position as favored child of their parents , Ann was happy to see him take the rap .
Her plan is to use the money she will eventually inherit from her parents to tempt Dwight into marriage .
She killed her mother to hasten the plan along , and Shana , Jean 's mother , because she was jealous of her friendship with Dwight .
Before Ann can kill Kinsey , she is interrupted by Royce , who wrestles the gun away from Ann , shooting her in the foot accidentally in the process.Ann is arrested for the murders of Shana and Oribelle , and although there is insufficient evidence to prove her the killer of Jean as well , the circumstances are sufficient to ensure that Bailey is cleared of the murder of Jean .

John Antes ( 1740 -- 1811 ) was the first American Moravian Missionary to travel and work in Egypt , one of the earliest American-born chamber music composers , and the maker of perhaps the earliest surviving bowed string instrument made in America .
Although Antes is often recognized for his choral works , such as Go Congregation Go !
and Surely he has Bourne our Griefs , the mystery surrounding the creation of his " six Quartettos " is also well known .
Biography 420 Antes was born on March 24 , 1740 in Frederick , Montgomery County , Pennsylvania .
In 1745 , Antes entered the Moravian Boys Boarding School , where he received music education from Johann Christoph Pyrlaeus .
Although Pyrlaeus might now be first-known as a teacher of Antes , he was the founder of the Bethlehem collegium musicum , a capable singer , instrumentalist , and organist , and was also a missionary to Native Americans .
In 1752 , John entered the boys school in Bethlehem , Pennsylvania and in 1760 , was admitted into the Single Brethren 's choir , also in Bethlehem.Antes left Bethlehem in 1764 and travelled to Herrnhut , Germany , the international center of the Moravians , to pursue a career as a missionary .
A year later he transferred to Neuwied , Germany , where he also trained as a watchmaker .
Antes was ordained as a Moravian Minister in January 1769 , and he left for Egypt that same month to serve as a missionary to the Coptic Church of Grand Cairo .
The first ten years of his mission were rather uneventful until 1779 , when Antes was captured and tortured by some of Osman Bey 's followers .
Antes spent his remaining two years in Egypt recovering from this incident.Antes returned to Herrnhut in 1781 .
Upon arrival , he began working as a business manager of the Single Brethren 's house in Neuwied .
In 1785 , he was named warder of an entire Moravian community in Fulneck , England .
Antes was married to Susanna Crabtree in 1786 , and spent the rest of his working life in Fulneck .
He retired to Bristol , England in 1809 , and died there in 1811 .
Composer Antes is well known for his vocal works , the two most famous anthems being Go , Congregation , Go !
and Surely He Hath Bourne Our Griefs .
It seems likely that Antes wrote most of his vocal pieces while working at the Fulneck Moravian settlement .
Most of his anthems use an English text , which support this idea , and the anthems that use German text were possibly written while he was in Neuwied , Germany the years before moving to Fulneck.Antes 's string trios appear to have been written during the final two years of his mission in Egypt , while recuperating from the traumatic assault .
The trios were published by John Bland , a London Publisher , during the early 1790s , under a pseudonym , " Giovanni A-T-S , " instead of the name Antes .
A common theory is that Antes did not consider himself a worthy composer , and therefore did not want to use his real name.Also while in Egypt , Antes wrote a letter to Benjamin Franklin , whom he had met previously in Philadelphia , stating that he was including " a copy of six quartettos " .
Although Antes states that he had also sent a copy to an otherwise unidentified colleague , to whom the quartets were dedicated , they have never been found .
420 prostate egsamsMusicologist Karl Kroeger believes that it is possible that Antes 's string trios are re-orchestrated versions of three of his six quartettos .
Instrument maker Before moving to Europe , Antes worked as an instrument maker .
His earliest dated instrument , which still exists today , is a violin from 1759 .
This violin is now housed in the Museum of the Moravian Historical Society in Nazareth , Pennsylvania .
A viola made by Antes in 1764 is believed to be " the earliest extant viola made in America [ and is ] housed in the Lititz Congregation Collection . "
Antes opened a shop in 1762 and the shop records show that he created up to seven bowed string instruments .
It is not known how Antes learned the craft of instrument making , although it is possible that he learned from Johann Gottlob Klemm , an American organ builder , who spent time in Bethlehem in 1757 .
Work Antes 's compositional style is often compared to that of Joseph Haydn , since the two were contemporaries .
The instrumentation of Antes 's string trios might have followed that of Haydn , who wrote 21 trios for the same scoring .
Haydn 's music was highly visible in the Moravian Church , most likely a large part of the music library at Fulneck , and joined that by other composers of the time such as Ignaz Pleyel , Muzio Clementi , George Frideric Handel and Jean Paul Egide Martini.Karl Kroeger states in his article " John Antes at Fulneck " that Antes 's music stands well alongside the work of other major composers of the day , with a nod to Haydn , as well as Franz Anton Hoffmeister and Carl Stamitz .
Kroeger also describes the string parts of Antes 's anthems as displaying , " subtle expression , contrapuntal interplay of motive , and idiomatic string writing . "
Antes 's vocal works often used texts that illustrated his individual and sometimes painful relationship with God .
This was often displayed through a " harmonic polarity between the tonic and the dominant . "
Antes was also fond of " dotted rhythms , melodic thirds , long vocal lines , high tessituras , and wide ranges , " as well as equal importance to each instrument as in his string trios .

Abortion in India is legal only up to twenty weeks of pregnancy under specific conditions and situations , which are broadly defined as : the continuance of the pregnancy would involve a risk to the life of the pregnant woman or of grave injury of physical or mental health , orthere is a substantial risk that if the child were born , it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped.Recently , the Supreme Court permitted a rape survivor to terminate her pregnancy at 24 weeks , which is beyond the permissible 20 weeks limit prescribed under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act , 1971 .
An adult woman requires no other person 's consent except her own.In many parts of India , daughters are not preferred and hence sex-selective abortion is commonly practised , resulting in an unnatural male to female population sex ratio due to millions of developing girls selectively being targeted for termination before birth .
Gender hierarchies , cultural norms , values and image of women in society are very important factors in Indian culture and the topic of abortion is considered very personal .
In India , the matter of termination of pregnancy is often not based on the perceptions of the woman herself , rather cultural , religious , socioeconomic and societal pressures play a significant role in influencing her decision .
Legal status Before 1971 The Indian Penal Code , enacted in 1860 and written in accordance with contemporaneous British law , declared induced abortion illegal .
Induced abortion was defined as purposely " causing miscarriage " .
The penalty for abortion practitioners was either three years in prison , or a fine , or both ; for the woman availing of an abortion , the penalty was either seven years in prison , or a fine , or both .
The only exception was when abortion was induced in order to save the life of the woman.The prevalence of illegal abortions , combined with the idea that abortion could be a mode of population control , caused the government to reconsider the law .
In 1964 , the Central Family Planning Board of the Government of India met and formed a committee to examine the subject of abortion from the medical , legal , social , and moral standpoints .
The Abortion Study Committee , headed by Mr. Shantilal Shah ( health minister of Maharashtra ) submitted its report in December 1966 .
This report suggested that the penal code was too restrictive and recommended that the exemptions under which abortion was permissible be increased and liberalised .
Many of the report 's suggestions were included in the subsequent Medical Termination of Pregnancy ( MTP ) Act .
1971 and beyond The Indian abortion laws falls under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy ( MTP ) Act , which was enacted by the Indian Parliament in the year 1971 with the intention of reducing the incidence of illegal abortion and consequent maternal mortality and morbidity .
The MTP Act came into effect from 1 April 1972 and was amended in the years 1975 and 2002 .
Pregnancies not exceeding 12 weeks may be terminated based on a single opinion formed in good faith .
In case of pregnancies exceeding 12 weeks but less than 20 weeks , termination needs opinion of two doctors .
The Medical Termination of Pregnancy ( MTP ) Act of India clearly states the conditions under which a pregnancy can be ended or aborted , the persons who are qualified to conduct the abortion and the place of implementation .
Some of these qualifications are as follows : Women whose physical and/or mental health were endangered by the pregnancyWomen facing the birth of a potentially handicapped or malformed childRapePregnancies in unmarried girls under the age of eighteen with the consent of a guardianPregnancies in " lunatics " with the consent of a guardianPregnancies that are a result of failure in sterilisation Statistics Ipas India reported in 2013 that unsafe abortions killed one woman for every two hours in India ( approximately 4,000 deaths a year ) , according to estimates and calculations correlating data on maternal mortality ratio and Sample Registration System ( SRS ) data .
A Lancet paper in 2007 said there were 6.4 million abortions , of which 3.6 million or 56 per cent were unsafe .
Based on the then available latest population and crude birth rate figures , Ipas put the figures of induced abortion at 5,007,932 .
According to 2011 Census , institutionalized abortion varied among Indian States from 32 per cent in Chhattisgarh to 73.9 per cent in Assam.In Bihar and Jharkhand , access to safe abortion services is also limited , with the two states reporting only 146 out of a total of 12,510 approved medical termination of pregnancy centres in India as of 2008 ( Ministry of Health and Family Welfare 2009 ) .
These two states also have one of the lower literacy rate and the population in both states is very high as compared to other states which can be one of the main reason of such a high rate of pregnancy termination as people are not informed enough .
Sex-selective abortion Pre-natal diagnostic techniques like Medical Ultrasonography are capable of determining the sex of the fetus .
In many parts of India , daughters are not preferred and hence sex-selective abortion is commonly practised , a form of Gendercide , resulting in an unnatural male to female population sex ratio due to millions of developing girls being terminated before birth .
According to The Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques ( Regulation and Prevention of Misuse ) Amendment Act , 2002 the following are cognisable , non-bailable and non-compoundable offencesConducting or associating or helping to conduct Pre-Natal Diagnostic tests for determining the sex of the foetus.Sex selection on a woman or a man or both on any tissue , embryo , conceptus fluid or gametes derived from either or both of themAdvertisement or communication in any form in print , by electronic media or internet by units , medical professionals or companies on the availability of sex determination and sex selection in the form of services , medicines , or any kind of techniques.Providers are punishable by three years imprisonment and a Rs. 10,000 fine ( five years imprisonment and a Rs. 50,000 fine for subsequent offence ) ; those who seek aid are punishable with a term that may extend to three years and a fine that may extend to Rs 50,000 for the first offence and for any subsequent offence with imprisonment which may extend to five years and with fine which may increase to Rs. 100,000 .
Implementation Unsafe abortions continue to outnumber safe and legal abortions .
The Central government constituted an expert committee in the year 2010 to make recommendations .

Mister Kite is a progressive metal/hard rock band from Malmö , Sweden .
Their music is best described as heavy yet melodic , with dark , brooding lyrics , drawing obvious influences from bands like Dream Theater .
Their name is taken from the Beatles song " Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite ! "
Early inception Formed in Malmö in 1999 by Alf Wemmenlind , Anton Johansson and Mats Bergentz , Mister Kite had done a few demo recordings when guitarist Kristensson stepped in with some fresh ideas .
He soon became a permanent member of the band .
In the summer of 2001 they felt they had enough material for a studio release , and with the old-friend-turned-keyboardist Djurfeldt completing the line-up , the recording of the first album started .
First albums The band signed to Finnish independent label Lion Music , which released the debut album All in Time in 2002 .
The release saw a guest appearance by Swedish guitar virtuoso Mattias IA Eklund of Freak Kitchen , on the song Seventeen Years .
All in Time received almost exclusively good reviews , yet failed to sell .
The band supported the album with a short tour , playing the Midtfyn Festival in Odense , Denmark , and later joined heavy metal band Dio as supporting act for their Killing the Dragon tour of Scandinavia.In the summer of 2003 the band entered the studio again to record their second album , Box of Fear .
This album saw the group move towards a heavier , darker sound .
The release was preceded by an EP , The Hunger , showcasing two songs from the new album as well as Bloodsucker , a Deep Purple cover taken from the Lion Music release Blackmore 's Castle , a tribute to Ritchie Blackmore .
Again , the album was given favorable reviews , and in supporting it Mister Kite joined Canadian prog act Saga for their Network tour .
Personnel change In 2005 , both Thomas Djurfeldt and Anton Johansson revealed that they intended to leave the band due to other commitments .
Replacements were found in 2006 in young guitarist Linus Abrahamson , taking up bass , and long-time-friend Robert Ahrling of Origin Blood joined as second guitarist .
This line-up performed a few well-received gigs before taking a break to write new material .
Since then , the band has released the song Wo n't Go Away , written specifically for the book STIGMA by Åsa Schwartz .
More information about the Stigma project can be found here .
Stigma official siteMagnus Kristensson died on June 10th , 2013 , of cancer.The band is currently reviewing material for a forthcoming third album .

The Metro Mass Transit Limited is a public transportation company in Ghana .
The company was set us to provide reliable and affordable means of transport for commuters within villages , towns , and cities as well as provide intercity movement .
Early Days Public bus companies have operated in Ghana since the Ominibus Service Authority ( OSA ) started its operations in 1927 .
The OSA contributed a lot to the Ghanaian society in terms of public transport .
However , OSA 's assets were divested in 1995 .
Conception Metro Mass Transit ( MMT ) arose from an idea from President John Kufuor who spoke of the need of introducing a mass transit bus system in the cities of Ghana at his inauguration speech on 7 January 2001 .
President Kufuor directed the re-introduction of public mass transport in the metropolitan and municipal areas to ensure the safe , affordable , efficient and reliable transport of commuters .
Since then , the government has been actively promoting public mass transportation.Metro Mass Transit Limited was officially incorporated in 2003 .
The shareholders include State Insurance Company ( SIC Insurance Company ) , National Investment Bank , Ghana Oil Company Limited , Agriculture Development Bank , Prudential Bank Limited and SSNIT .
These together have 55 % shareholding .
The Government of Ghana holds the remaining 45 % shares .
Operational Areas Since the introduction of the Metro Mass Transit , the following areas have benefited from the service : Accra Metropolitan AreaTema Metropolitan AreaKumasi Metropolitan AreaSekondi-Takoradi Metropolitan AreaTamale Metropolitan AreaNew Juaben Municipal AreaSunyani Municipal AreaCape Coast Metropolitan AreaAgona West Municipal AreaHo Municipal AreaWa Municipal AreaBolgatanga MunicipalBirim Central Municipal Area Fleet Size MMT at the moment has a fleet of buses made up of Yaxing , DAF , Neoplan VDL , VDL Jonckhere , VDL Dutch , and Iveco buses .
It is expected that the size of the fleet will reach 1,000 by the end of the year 2008 .
The Fiat-Iveco buses were donated by the Italian Government and helped a great deal during the pilot phase .
These buses have played their part and are being phased out.The Yaxing buses were manufactured in China and supported by the Ghana Government .
On 13 April 2006 , MMT received 150 Yaxing buses from the Ministry of Roads and Transport ( MRT ) to augment the MMT fleet .
This brought the total number of Yaxing buses received to 400 and the total operational MMT fleet to over 600 .
As of early 2016 all Yaxing buses have been scrapped and are no longer in service.All DAF & VDL buses have been financed through an ORET Grant agreement between the Dutch Government and Ghana .
Thirty-five percent of the value is a gift of the Dutch Government whilst 65 % has been provided as a loan .
All DAF Neoplaan & VDL Neoplan buses are manufactured at the Neoplan factory in Kumasi .
Passengers Carried MMT carried almost 40 million passengers nationwide from January to October 2007 over 12,000,000 kilometres ( 7,500,000 mi ) .
MMT buses have carried 36,456,300 passengers nationwide and have given 3,724,644 school children free ride .
Operational Issues A pilot Bus Rapid Transit project in Accra , connecting Adenta with the Central Business District and the Kwame Nkrumah Circle , carrying over 20,000 passengers a day commenced in September 2005 .
The buses operate every 15 minutes and tickets are sold in advance .
Mission & Vision Mission The mission of MMT is to provide an efficient urban mass transport system in Ghana through the use of buses .
Vision To build a dominant , reliable , efficient , safe and affordable yet an economically sustainable mass transit public bus company in Ghana .
MMT also aims to introduce the Bus Rapid Transit System into Ghana .
Job Creations MMT has grown to be one of the major employers in Ghana .
MMT 's current staff strength of around 2,474 is expected to exceed 3000 by the end of 2008 with the arrival of about 258 buses .
Janitorial services , security , bus washing and cleaning are outsourced to third parties providing employment for additional 500 persons .
On account of the construction of the buses in Kumasi , several indirect jobs have been created in the manufacturing sector .
In general productivity of the workforce in Ghana would increase , since MMT can offer fast and reliable transport from home to the workplace .
Moreover , the operations of MMT would empower the Ghanaian community by making job , shop , school and healthcare better accessible .
Awards In the year 2013 , MMT won the International Transport Awards .
It also won the overall award in the National Road Safety awards scheme on October 2013 in the Eastern Region of Ghana .

Early life Few was born in Cleveland , Ohio , and grew up in the Fairfax neighborhood of the city 's East Side .
Upon his mother 's encouragement , he studied classical piano but later discovered jazz upon listening to his father 's Jazz at the Philharmonic records .
His father became his first booking agent and soon Few was gigging around the greater Cleveland area with other local musicians including Bill Hardman , Bob Cunningham , Cevera Jefferies and Frank Wright .
He was exposed to Tadd Dameron and Benny Bailey as a youth and knew Albert Ayler , with whom he played in high school .
As a young man , Few also gigged with local tenor legend Tony " Big T " Lovano - Joe Lovano 's father .
Career In the late 1950s Few relocated to New York , where he led a trio from 1958 to 1964 ; there , he met and began working with many world class musicians , including singer Brook Benton , and saxophonists Rahsaan Roland Kirk , Jackie McLean , Joe Henderson and Ayler .

In 1969 he moved to France and rapidly integrated the expatriate jazz community , working frequently with Archie Shepp , Sunny Murray , Steve Lacy and Rasul Siddik .
Since 2001 , he has played regularly with American saxophonist Avram Fefer , with whom he recorded four critically acclaimed CDs.Few has played extensively around Europe and continues to make regular trips back to the United States .

Few was interviewed in a 2008 documentary , later released on DVD , on drummer Sunny Murray - " Sunny 's Time Now " .
Playing style Some of Few 's various playing styles were described by Kevin Whitehead : " He can play delicate single-note melodies , roll out lush romantic chords , rap out explicitly Monkish close-interval clanks - though he 's a busier pianist than Monk - or roil around in classic free style , using a sustain pedal to shape the density of his sound " .

PSR B1828-11 ( also known as PSR B1828-10 ) is a pulsar approximately 10,000 light-years away in the constellation of Scutum .
The star exhibits variations in the timing and shape of its pulses : this was at one stage interpreted as due to a possible planetary system in orbit around the pulsar , though the model required an anomalously large second period derivative of the pulse times .
The planetary model was later discarded in favour of precession effects as the planets could not cause the observed shape variations of the pulses .
While the generally accepted model is that the pulsar is a neutron star undergoing free precession , a model has been proposed that interprets the pulsar as a quark star undergoing forced precession due to an orbiting " quark planet " .
The entry for the pulsar on SIMBAD lists this hypothesis as being controversial .

Bandua was a theonym used to refer to a god or goddess worshipped in Iberia by Gallaeci and Lusitanians .
Whether the name referred to a discrete deity or was an epithet applied to different deities is arguable .
Extent of worship The theonym Bandua has been found recorded in Portugal and Galicia .
The name is found with a number of epithets.In Rairiz de Veiga , Bandua is acknowledged as a god of the Vexillum and partner of Mars : Deo Vexilor [ um ] martis socio Banduae.At Espinhosela , the name Bandua alone is found .
At Codosedo , Alenquer and Xinzo de Limia however , the name Bandua is qualified by the epithet Aetobrico ( m ) .
At Cáceres , Bandua is qualified by Araugelensis , at Curbián by Bolleco ( m ) , at Miguel o Anjo by Brico ( m ) , at Mixo ( m ) by Calaigus , at La Mezquitilla by Itobrico ( m ) , at Eiras by Lanobrica , at Rairiz de Veiga by Veigebreaeco ( m ) , at Arcuelos by Verubrigo ( m ) , at Seisco de Anciães by Vordeaeco ( m ) and at S. Martinho by Vorteaecio ( m ) .
Along with Cosus , Nabia and Reo , Bandua is one of the best documented deities in large areas of western and north-western Iberia.It has been proposed that the worship of Bandua spread from the north ( Gallaecia and Asturia ) into the south ( Lusitania ) , along with that of Cosus and Nabia , so contrasting with the worship of Reo that would have extended in the opposite direction .
Interpretations Bandua has been associated with water in order to explain the hydronym Banduje , in Portugal , or the toponym Banhos de Bande ( a thermal spot whose medieval name , Vanate , is unrelated ) and the proposed relationship of the name with fords.The form Bandue , and the form Bandua or Banduae , predominate in the Galician territory north of the Douro River , while the Bandi ~ Bande form is more common in the Lusitanian area to the south .
Its epithets seem to allude more to dwelling places , at least those containing the element - briga or - bris , " fortress " : Lanobrigae , Aetobrigo , than to the worshipping communities themselves .
This theory has been recently criticized by de Bernardo Stempel , who interprets what have traditionally been considered singular thematic datives of male attributes as plural genitive forms referring to groups of people ( B'andue Aetobrico ( m ) , Cadogo ( m ) , Roudeaeco ( m ) , Veigebreaego ( m ) ) .
She also states that they depend on a theonym , Bandua , which would be feminine as a consequence of the above , and which was probably created later than its masculine counterpart .
Thus , we would have a pair of deities , Bandus ( male ) and Bandua ( female ) , comparable to other Celtic pairs like Bormanos & Bormana , Belisama & Belisamaros , Camulos & Camuloriga and Arentius & Arentia.It has recently been proposed that St. Torquatus , one of the Seven Apostolic Men responsible for the introduction of Christianity to Hispania , whose relics are kept in Santa Comba de Bande ( Ourense ) , may be a Christian version of Bandua .

Li Rizhi ( 李日知 ) ( died 715 ) was an official of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty and Wu Zetian 's Zhou Dynasty , serving as a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Ruizong .
Background It is not known when Li Rizhi was born , but it is known that his family was from Zheng Prefecture ( 鄭州 , roughly modern Zhengzhou , Henan ) .
His family traced its ancestry to the great Warring States period Zhao general Li Mu .
At some point , Li passed the imperial examinations .
During Wu Zetian 's reign During Wu Zetian 's Tianshou era ( 690-692 ) , he served as a Sixing Cheng ( 司刑丞 ) -- a judge at the supreme court .
It was said that at that time , the judges were often cruel , but Li was kind and tried to avoid unjust penalties for defendants .
In one case , he spared a defendant from death , but the deputy chief judge , Hu Yuanli ( 胡元禮 ) ordered that the defendant be executed .
They exchanged dissenting paperwork between themselves four times .
Eventually , Hu angrily stated , " As long as I am still here , this defendant will not be spared . "
Li responded , " As long as I am still here , this defendant will not be executed . "
They both submitted their opinions to Wu Zetian , and she decided in favor of Li .
During Emperor Zhongzong 's second reign Later , during the Shenlong era ( 705-707 ) of Wu Zetian 's son Emperor Zhongzong , Li Rizhi served as Jishizhong ( 給事中 ) , an imperial attendant .
At that time , his mother was old and ill , and Li personally attended to her and was so worried that his hair turned white .
Sometime thereafter , he was given the honorific title Chaosan Daifu ( 朝散大夫 ) , and Emperor Zhongzong was poised to grant his mother a title as well .
However , she died before she could be so honored .
As she was set to be buried , the imperial messenger arrived with his mother 's commission , and he was so overwhelmed by emotions that he fainted .
The official sent to review matters in the circuit that Zheng Prefecture belonged to , Jing Qian ( 敬濳 ) , heard of this , and was set to report to the emperor Li 's great filial piety , but Li declined .
After he finished observing the mourning period for his mother , he was recalled to government service to serve as Huangmen Shilang ( 黃門侍郎 ) , the deputy head of the examination bureau of government ( 門下省 , Menxia Sheng ) .
In 709 , Emperor Zhongzong 's powerful daughter Li Guo'er the Princess Anle had just completed building a new mansion and a magnificent artificial pond that she named Dingkun Pond ( 定昆池 ) .
Emperor Zhongzong personally visited her mansion , and the officials attending to him all wrote poems praising the beauty of the pond .
Li Rizhi , however , wrote a poem that had the tenor of trying to correct her behavior , including the lines : I wish the person who lives here briefly can relax.Do not forget the labors of those who built this place.These lines became well-known .
( Later , Emperor Zhongzong 's brother Li Dan the Prince of Xiang , after he became emperor in 710 , would comment to Li Rizhi , " At that time , not even I dared to say something like that . )
During Emperor Shang 's reign and Emperor Ruizong 's second reign In 710 , Emperor Zhongzong died suddenly -- a death that traditional historians believed to be a poisoning carried out by his wife Empress Wei and Li Guo'er , so that Empress Wei could become " emperor " like Wu Zetian , and Li Guo'er could become crown princess .
Meanwhile , Emperor Zhongzong 's son by a concubine , Li Chongmao the Prince of Wen was named emperor ( as Emperor Shang ) , but Empress Wei retained power as empress dowager and regent .
Less than a month later , Emperor Zhongzong 's sister Princess Taiping and Li Dan 's son Li Longji the Prince of Linzi rose in rebellion and killed Empress Dowager Wei and Li Guo'er .
Li Dan became regent , and he gave Li Rizhi the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin ( 同中書門下三品 ) , making him a chancellor de facto .
Several days later , Li Dan , who was formerly emperor , took the throne again himself ( as Emperor Ruizong ) , displacing Emperor Shang.In spring 711 , after fellow chancellors Yao Yuanzhi and Song Jing were removed form office , Li Rizhi and Wei Anshi became the lead chancellors , and it was said that the reforms that Yao and Song tried to carry out after Emperor Zhongzong 's reign were reversed , and that the government was disorganized .
Later that year , Li Rizhi was made acting Shizhong ( 侍中 ) , the head of the examination bureau and a post considered one for a chancellor .
In winter 711 , as a part of a major governmental reorganization , Li Rizhi and fellow chancellors Wei , Guo Yuanzhen , Dou Huaizhen , and Zhang Shuo were removed from their chancellor posts , and Li became the minister of census ( 戶部尚書 , Hubu Shangshu ) .
During Emperor Xuanzong 's reign In 712 , Emperor Ruizong passed the throne to Li Longji , who took the throne as Emperor Xuanzong .
Later that year , Li Rizhi , who was then the minister of justice ( 刑部尚書 ) , requested retirement , and the request was approved .
Prior to making the request , he did not tell his wife , and when he returned home , he began to prepare moving to a country residence .
His wife , surprised , stated , " We do not have much asset , and your sons and brothers have not had a chance to become officials in government .
Why do you wish to resign ? "
He responded , " I am a simple scholar , and what I have already exceeds what I should have .
Human desires can never be fulfilled , and I should not pamper my heart . "
Once he retired to the countryside , he did not spend time managing assets , but rather built ponds and pavilions , and often invited younger scholars to discuss things with them .
He died in 715 .
It was said that Li Rizhi , contrary to the harshness of supervising officials at the time , never caned his subordinates for faults .
On one occasion , a low-level official at the ministry of justice received an imperial edict but forgot to act on it for three days .
Li Rizhi became angry and took a cane .
After gathering the subordinates , he acted as if he would cane the forgetful subordinate , but then stated , " If I caned you , everyone will state that you are so negligent that you even drew Li Rizhi 's anger and was caned by him .
Everyone will shame you , and even your wife will abandon you . "
He then released the subordinate from punishment , and the man and the other subordinates were thankful .
However , Li was also criticized for having all of his sons take wives from prominent clans .
After his death , his youngest son Li Yiheng ( 李伊衡 ) promoted a concubine to be his wife -- an act considered highly violative of Confucian principles -- and was wasteful and litigious toward his brothers , causing the reputation of the clan to suffer greatly .

The Hermitage Club at Haystack Mountain is a mid-sized alpine ski area located in Deerfield Valley Southern Vermont Haystack Mountain in Wilmington , Vermont .
Early operations The ski area featured two unique areas , complete with lodges and chairlifts .
Haystack opened in the early 1960s as an alternative to crowded resorts .
The upper mountain , serviced originally by the Oh No double chairlift ( a Mueller installed in 1965 ) , featured over one thousand vertical feet of trails for intermediates and experts .
The lower mountain , serviced by multiple lifts ( including Haymaker a Mueller double chairlift ) , featured shorter trails for beginners .
For many years , a transfer chairlift connected the lower and upper areas.In the mid 1980s a significant expansion took place , resulting in the installation of three new triple chairlifts , including a CTEC chairlift serving a new expert complex called " The Witches . "
The " Witches " is known for its tough terrain that even challenges experts .
Mount Snow merger In 1991 , S-K-I Ltd. , owners of nearby Mount Snow , purchased Haystack and soon began promoting the two ski areas as one .
Though they were never connected by alpine ski trails or lifts , ( there is a Nordic trail along the ridge between the two ) , trail counts and snow reports were often combined.In 1996 S-K-I Ltd. merged with LBO Resort Enterprises , forming the American Skiing Company .
The American Skiing Company ( ASC ) would soon hit financial troubles , resulting in the scaling back of operations at Haystack .
By the end of its ownership of Haystack , ASC limited operations to weekend and holiday periods .
Sale and closure On March 30 , 2005 , the American Skiing Company announced it had sold Haystack Mountain Ski Area for $ 5,000,000 to a group of local businessmen .
The Haystack Club concept was created as a result , with the plans to open an upscale private ski area .
The Club will include Town House Villas as well as a new Hybrid " chondola " ( A lift with chairs and gondola cabins ) to the summit .
The " oh-no " Double will be removed .
Barnstormer will also now service as a beginner area lift and transfer lift .
The Haystack Club has been open since the sale .
The club was open for two days of groomed uncrowded skiing for the members .
Although they were open only two days because they got sued by Mount Snow for water rights .
The Haystack Club The Haystack Club has started renovations .
Four town houses were torn down .
Additionally , the Upper Base Lodge is being renovated to be turned into the " Hay Loft . "
The Club will sell 900 family memberships .
Benefits include exclusive skiing , uncrowded , as well as access to a golf club and Equestrian Center .
Also , along with the 900 memberships , everyday 450 Tickets will be sold to Wilmington Residents for the day .
As of winter 2010 the area will not operate for skiing this year .
The old Upper Base Lodge has been completely demolished .
December 2011 Update This earlier effort to develop Haystack Club failed .
However ' First Tracks !!
Online Ski Magazine ' reports that another members-only plan is currently in process after the owner of the Hermitage Inn , Jim Barnes , purchased the Haystack ski area and golf course in October 2011 , for $ 6.5 million , saying he plans to reopen the ski area in a similar manner.Barnes ’ plan includes 450 planned homes and condos with prices starting at $ 650,000 .
He stated he hoped to have the ski area open on weekends beginning in late December , 2011 .
The slopes would be open only to prospective members and residents of Wilmington to whom Barnes would offer 250 lift tickets per day at reduced prices .
The Hermitage Club At Haystack Mountain In September 2012 The Haystack Club and Haystack Golf course became The Hermitage Club At Haystack Mountain and The Hermitage Golf Club at Haystack Mountain .
Hermitage Club Permit Violations Lawsuit According to a lawsuit filed by the Vermont Attorney General 's Office , the group allegedly performed construction activities without land use permits , performed construction activities without a storm water permit , constructed a building without a wastewater and potable water supply permit and disturbed a wetland without approval .
In his response , Hermitage Club President Jim Barnes said “ Although the Hermitage did n’t agree with the allegations we agreed to 100 % mitigation at our expense . "
The Hermitage continued further dialogue with the state and although disagreeing with the penalties proposed , offered a proposal to settle this issue which has since been rejected.Summer 2015 In the summer of 2015 , the Club has replaced the Barnstormer Triple with the Barnstormer Express Six Person Bubble Chair .
Also a new lodge has been constructed at the top of the Hayfever Triple .

The Chronica Gallica of 452 , also called the Gallic Chronicle of 452 , is a Latin chronicle of Late Antiquity , presented in the form of annals , which continues that of Jerome .
It was edited by Theodor Mommsen in the Monumenta Germaniae Historica as Chronica Gallica A. CCCCLII , along with another anonymous Gallic chronicle , the Chronica Gallica of 511 .
The chronicle begins in 379 with the elevation of Theodosius I as co-emperor , and ends with the attack of Attila , king of the Huns , on Italy in 452 .
The contents focus on Gaul , the emperors and the popes , while events in the eastern part of the empire find little mention .
It is the oldest preserved historical work from Gaul .
The place of origin is controversial , but most likely somewhere in the Rhône Valley or , as some suggest , specifically Marseilles.The Chronica Gallica of 511 , edited in the same MGH volume , also begins with Theodosius , but covers the period up to 511 .

The Body Bag Game was a Monday Night Football game that was played on November 12 , 1990 , between the Philadelphia Eagles and Washington Redskins at Veterans Stadium .
The Eagles defeated the Redskins , 28 -- 14 .
Its nickname comes from the fact that nine Washington Redskins players left the game with injuries , and an Eagles player who reacted to one of those injured Redskins by yelling , " Do you guys need any more body bags ? "
Background and game This was the second game of the year between the two NFC East rivals .
The Redskins were two years removed from winning Super Bowl XXII , but were an aging team , behind a new quarterback , Jeff Rutledge .
The Eagles were in their fifth season under defensive mastermind Buddy Ryan , but coming off two straight early playoff exits .
In the previous game , on October 21 , the 3 -- 2 Redskins beat the 2 -- 3 Eagles 13 -- 7 , behind a rushing touchdown by Gerald Riggs and two Chip Lohmiller field goals .
The rematch would come three weeks later , on Monday Night Football , with the second-place Redskins being 5 -- 3 and the third-place Eagles being 4 -- 4 .
The Eagles would score first , on a 30-yard interception return for a touchdown by cornerback William Frizzell .
In the second quarter , the Redskins would tie the game 7 -- 7 behind a Rutledge pass to tight end Don Warren .
However , by the third quarter , the Eagles took control with three touchdowns .
The first came on a trick play , with fullback Keith Byars throwing a 9-yard pass to Heath Sherman .
The second came via the defense , with defensive end Clyde Simmons returning a fumble 18 yards .
The final touchdown was another pass to Sherman , this time by quarterback Randall Cunningham .
The Redskins would finish the scoring in the fourth quarter , with Brian Mitchell scoring on a one-yard run , but it would not lead to a comeback , with the Eagles winning 28 -- 14 .
During this game , eight Redskin players were injured , including starting quarterback Jeff Rutledge and backup Stan Humphries .
Washington , already playing without quarterbacks Mark Rypien ( who was injured earlier in the season ) and Gary Hogeboom ( inactive ) , had to end the game with rookie running back Brian Mitchell at quarterback .
Aftermath Following the Body Bag Game , the Eagles won five of their last seven under Cunningham , finished the season 10 -- 6 and earned a wild card playoff berth , the fourth seed in the tough NFC .
The Redskins meanwhile also won five of their last seven to finish the season 10 -- 6 , losing the number four seed spot to the Eagles .
Despite this , the Redskins would return to Veterans Stadium and defeat the Eagles in the Wild Card playoff game , 20 -- 6 .
The Redskins lost to defending Super Bowl champion San Francisco in the divisional round .
However , as told in the NFL Network presentation America 's Game : The Story of the 1991 Washington Redskins , coach Joe Gibbs and others pointed to this game as the foundation for the successes of the 1991 Redskins , who would go on to win Super Bowl XXVI.After the season , the NFL addressed the problem of two quarterbacks being injured in the same game by instituting the third quarterback rule , which would allow an NFL team to dress a third quarterback outside of the 45-man game-day roster .
Under that rule , the third quarterback could be played , but if he entered the game before the fourth quarter , neither of the other quarterbacks could return to the game .
That rule was changed again for the 2011 season when the game-day roster size was increased to 46 .
Eminem references this game in his song " Legacy " on The Marshall Mathers LP 2 .

The DAF Daffodil is a small family car that was manufactured by DAF from 1961 until 1967 .
It replaced the DAF 600 .
At the same time DAF launched the DAF 750 which was essentially the same car but with less luxurious fittings and less chrome trim on the outside .
The Daffodil was conceived as an export version of the 750 , market response dictated that the 750 ceased production in 1963 while the Daffodil , benefitting from a succession of mild face lifts , remained in production until 1967 .
The Daffodil was replaced by the very similar but slightly more powerful DAF 33 .
The names The Daffodil name worked well in some markets , but in Germany the more luxuriously equipped version of the DAF 750 was known as the DAF 30 .
Upgrades in 1963 and 1965 were marked by name changes to DAF 31 and DAF 32 .
In these markets the launch of the DAF 33 in 1967 was merely a continuation of an existing line .
The engine The 746 cc four stroke air cooled 2 cylinder Boxer engine had the same stroke as in the 600 , but the bore was increased from 76 mm to 85.5 mm .
Claimed power output was also increased from 22 bhp ( 16 kW ) to 30 bhp ( 22 kW ) , and a maximum speed of 105 km/h ( 65 mph ) was claimed .
0-50 MPH time was a 29 seconds , as tested by the Consumers Union in the United States .
Running gear The DAF 600 was the first car to have a continuously variable transmission ( CVT ) system - the innovative DAF Variomatic. , the same system was carried over to the 750 and its variants .
The DAF Variomatic employs centrifugal weights to control the drive ratio of the transmission and is enhanced by the engine manifold vacuum .
The action of the bob weights and inlet vacuum combined to pull together the cheeks of two , variable diameter , driving pulleys , driven directly from the engine .
These were connected , by rubber ' V ' belts , to two similar driven pulleys , connected to the drive wheels .
The cheeks of the driven pulleys were held together by spring tension , which was progressively overcome as the drive pulleys expanded and the tension of the belts increased .
The DAF Variomatics were thereby the only cars ever produced which went faster by the simple expedient of gently and gradually releasing the accelerator once top engine speed had been reached , as the increased vacuum took over from the reducing bob weight speed .
The Variomatic also permitted increased engine braking by operating a switch on the dashboard which reversed the action of the vacuum on the pulley 's diaphragm , seeking a lower ratio with increased manifold vacuum .
Two separate transmissions ran the two driving wheels , eliminating the need for a differential .
The two transmissions could provide different drive ratios , permitting the wheels to rotate at different speeds .
The duplication also provided redundancy .
If one belt broke , the vehicle could still be driven .
An interesting feature : putting the car in reverse reversed the entire drive system .
This enabled the vehicle , at least the earlier examples , in theory to reach the same top speed in reverse as forward .
Chronology Between 1961 and 1967 the mechanical aspects of the car were not significantly changed .1963 marked the withdrawal of the 750 and 30 badges , and the DAF 30 was replaced by the DAF 31 .
The exterior of the car was modestly reworked with input from Giovanni Michelotti which involved sharpened angles and more prominent fins : the interior was also significantly upgraded.In 1965 the DAF 32 replaced the DAF 31 .
This upgrade was marked by further limited changes to the body panels , again involving Michelotti whose influence would continue to be seen on DAF passenger cars until the Limburg car assembly business was acquired by Volvo .
Popular references The DAF Daffodil appeared in the 1960s spy drama series The Baron , driven by Cordelia ( Sue Lloyd ) .
It also gave its name to the late 80 's / early 90 's Manchester Indie band The New Fast Automatic Daffodils , after an advert for the car , which stated " The New , Fast Daffodil - fully Automatic " .

Cloud Cock OO Grand is an album by the Japanese noise musician Merzbow .
It was Merzbow 's first CD and showcases his then-new harsh noise style.It was reissued in the Merzbox ( 2000 ) . "
Autopussy Go No Go " was included on the Merzbox Sampler .
Background For the European tour of 1989 , Masami Akita could only bring simple and portable equipment , this led to the harsh noise style that Merzbow became known for in the 1990s .
Cloud Cock OO Grand was the first example of this new style , Merzbow 's first digital recording , and the first recorded specifically for the CD format .
It also includes live material from the European tour.But when I started live in late 1980 's I did n't like to use tape on stage .
I like only live electronics .
So , my studio works changed to more live composition style .
I 'm still using many tapes in studio works , but difference is I treat tapes and instruments .
Before , I used tapes as overdubbing concept .
But now tapes are crashing together , no static overdub .
I found that style on Cloud Cock OO Grand .
Track listing All music composed by Masami Akita .
Personnel Masami Akita -- materials , mixingReiko Azuma -- performer on live material on " Modular " Peter Duimelinks -- recorded live material on " Modular " Notes " Modular " includes material recorded live at V2 , s ' Hertogenbosch and Diogenes , Nijmegen during the Dutch tour in 1989 . "
Modular " and " Postfix " are listed as separate tracks , but only have one index track .

The 1988 United States presidential election in Missouri took place on November 8 , 1988 .
All 50 states and the District of Columbia , were part of the 1988 United States presidential election .
Missouri voters chose 11 electors to the Electoral College , which selected the President and Vice President.Missouri was won by incumbent United States Vice President George H. W. Bush of Texas , who was running against Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis .
Bush ran with Indiana Senator Dan Quayle as Vice President , and Dukakis ran with Texas Senator Lloyd Bentsen.Missouri weighed in for this election as 2 % more Democratic than the national average .
Partisan background The presidential election of 1988 was a very partisan election for Missouri , with more than 99 % of the electorate voting for either the Democratic or Republican parties , and only three parties total appearing on the ballot .
In typical form for the time , the more rural counties in Missouri turned out for the Republican candidate , while the more populated centers of the city of St. Louis ( though , notably , not St. Louis County ) , and East Kansas City , voted overwhelmingly Democratic .
As of 2017 , this is the last election in which St. Louis County voted for the Republican candidate .
Republican victory Bush won the election in the battle-ground State of Missouri by a narrow 3 point margin which was far below the margin of support the state gave Reagan just four years earlier .
Bush 's loss of many northern rural counties combined with Dukakis 's stronger than normal performance across much of the state and his over performance in the St. Louis city area made the final election results in this state much closer than usual .
The election results in Missouri are reflective of a nationwide reconsolidation of base for the Republican Party , which took place through the 1980s .
Through the passage of some very controversial economic programs , spearheaded by then President Ronald Reagan ( called , collectively , " Reaganomics " ) , the mid-to-late 1980 's saw a period of economic growth and stability .
The hallmark for Reaganomics was , in part , the wide-scale deregulation of corporate interests , and tax cuts for the wealthy.Dukakis ran on a notably socially liberal agenda , and advocated for higher economic regulation and environmental protection .
Bush , alternatively , ran on a campaign of continuing the social and economic policies of former President Reagan - which gained him much support with social conservatives , who largely associated the Republican Party with the economic growth of the 1980s .
Additionally , while the economic programs passed under Reagan , and furthered under Bush and Clinton , may have boosted the economy for a brief period , they are criticized by many analysts as " setting the stage " for economic troubles in the United State after 2007 , such as the Great Recession.Since 1904 , Missouri has voted for the eventual winner of the election in a presidential election , with the exceptions of the 1956 , 2008 , and 2012 elections .

Light Warlpiri is a mixed language of Australia , with indigenous Warlpiri , Kriol , and Standard Australian English as its parent languages .
First documented by linguist Carmel O'Shannessy of the University of Michigan , it is spoken in the Lajamanu community , mostly by people under the age of 35 .
As of 2013 , there were 350 native speakers of Light Warlpiri , although all of the speakers also knew traditional Warlpiri and many speak Kriol and English .
Characteristics Like other mixed languages , such as Gurindji Kriol , Michif and Medny Aleut , Light Warlpiri takes its nominal and verbal systems from different source languages .
Most nouns are from Warlpiri or English , and take Warlpiri case-marking ; but , most verbs and the verbal inflection/auxiliary structure is both borrowed and significantly reanalyzed from Kriol and Australian Aboriginal English .
History Light Warlpiri appears to have originated in the 1980s as a codification and expansion of the Warlpiri/English codeswitching patterns seen in members of the community over age 35 .
Within the community , it is perceived as a form of Warlpiri , although it is not always comprehensible to older speakers .

Fritz ter Meer ( 4 July 1884 -- 27 October 1967 ) was a German chemist.From 1925 to 1945 Fritz ter Meer was on the board of IG Farben AG .
He was involved in the planning of Monowitz concentration camp , a satellite camp of KZ Auschwitz .
Fritz ter Meer was sentenced to seven years in prison in the Nuremberg Trials in 1948 .
After he was released in 1951 he became supervisory board chairman ( Aufsichtsratsvorsitzender ) of Bayer AG .
Early life Fritz ter Meer was the son of Edmund ter Meer ( 1852 -- 1931 ) , who founded the chemical company Teerfarbenfabrik Dr. E. ter Meer & Cie in Uerdingen , which in 1925 became part of IG Farben .
His family tree can be traced back to the 15th Century.After completing his schooling from 1903 to 1908 ter Meer studied in France and Germany also briefly chemistry and law .
He received his doctorate in 1909 in Berlin with regard to the thesis of the ether Isonitrosoketonen .
Subsequently , in-depth studies followed the dye chemistry in Krefeld and abroad in France and England .
Career Thereafter , he worked in the family-owned company Dr. E. ter Meer & Co. , where he held senior positions and in 1919 became a member of the Board .
After the merger he worked for IG Farben until 1945 .
From 1925 to 1945 Fritz ter Meer was on the board of IG Farben AG .
He was also from 1932 a member of the Working Committee and the Technical Committee , Head of Division II in the War Ministry and the defense industry .
In May 1937 , he joined the NSDAP .
During World War II On 7 September 1939 he and Henry agreed with the Army Ordnance Hörlein the production of the nerve gas tabun .
More than 100 prisoners of war were used during construction of the designated poison gas factory in Dyhernfurth.He was involved in the planning of Monowitz concentration camp , a satellite camp of KZ Auschwitz and responsible for helping build the IG Farben Buna Werke factory at Auschwitz , which conducted human experiments and held some 25,000 forced laborers under deplorable conditions .
[ 1 ] In September 1943 he became General Agent for Italy , the Reich Minister for armaments and war production .
In 1943 ter Meer received the Knight 's Cross of War Merit Cross .
Post-war After his arrest in April 1945 , ter Meer was tried at the IG Farben Trial on 30 July 1948 for looting and enslavement in the context of the concentration camp Auschwitz III Monowitz .
He was sentenced to seven years imprisonment .
When he was interviewed in the process , asked whether he had considered the tests on humans in Auschwitz to be justified , he replied that this was irrelevant : " They were prisoners thus no particular harm was inflicted , as they would have been killed anyway . "
He was released early in the summer of 1950 because of " good behavior " in prison for war criminals from the prison in Landsberg and was given the removal of the restrictive clause of the Allied War Crimes Act No. 35 in 1956 and became Chairman of Bayer AG .
In subsequent years , he also took on board positions at a number of other companies , including , inter alia , Theodor Goldschmidt AG , Commerzbank AG , Bank Association , Duewag , VIAG and Union Bank AG , West Germany .
His achievements in the reconstruction of the chemical industry in Germany are considered significant.He retired in 1961 .
In his memory , his employer set up the Fritz-ter-Meer-Stiftung , now called the Bayer Science & Education Foundation , which promotes chemistry students through scholarships .

In foundations of mathematics , philosophy of mathematics , and philosophy of logic , formalism is a theory that holds that statements of mathematics and logic can be considered to be statements about the consequences of certain string manipulation rules.For example , Euclidean geometry can be considered a game whose play consists in moving around certain strings of symbols called axioms according to a set of rules called " rules of inference " to generate new strings .
In playing this game one can " prove " that the Pythagorean theorem is valid because the string representing the Pythagorean theorem can be constructed using only the stated rules.According to formalism , the truths expressed in logic and mathematics are not about numbers , sets , or triangles or any other contensive subject matter -- in fact , they are n't " about " anything at all .
They are syntactic forms whose shapes and locations have no meaning unless they are given an interpretation ( or semantics ) .
Formalism is associated with rigorous method .
In common use , a formalism means the out-turn of the effort towards formalisation of a given limited area .
In other words , matters can be formally discussed once captured in a formal system , or commonly enough within something formalisable with claims to be one .
Complete formalisation is in the domain of computer science.Formalism stresses axiomatic proofs using theorems , specifically associated with David Hilbert .
A formalist is an individual who belongs to the school of formalism , which is a certain mathematical-philosophical doctrine descending from Hilbert.Formalists are relatively tolerant and inviting to new approaches to logic , non-standard number systems , new set theories , etc. .
The more games we study , the better .
However , in all three of these examples , motivation is drawn from existing mathematical or philosophical concerns .
The " games " are usually not arbitrary.Recently , some formalist mathematicians have proposed that all of our formal mathematical knowledge should be systematically encoded in computer-readable formats , in order to facilitate automated proof checking of mathematical proofs and the use of interactive theorem proving in the development of mathematical theories and computer software .
Because of their close connection with computer science , this idea is also advocated by mathematical intuitionists and constructivists in the " computability " tradition ( see below ) .
Deductivism Another version of formalism is often known as deductivism .
In deductivism , the Pythagorean theorem is not an absolute truth , but a relative one.This is to say , that if you interpret the strings in such a way that the rules of the game become true then you have to accept that the theorem , or , rather , the interpretation of the theorem you have given it must be a true statement .
( The rules of such a game would have to include , for instance , that true statements are assigned to the axioms , and that the rules of inference are truth-preserving , etcetera . )
Under deductivism , the same view is held to be true for all other statements of formal logic and mathematics .
Thus , formalism need not mean that these deductive sciences are nothing more than meaningless symbolic games .
It is usually hoped that there exists some interpretation in which the rules of the game hold .
Compare this position to structuralism.Taking the deductivist view allows the working mathematician to suspend judgement on the deep philosophical questions and proceed as if solid epistemological foundations were available .
Many formalists would say that in practice , the axiom systems to be studied are suggested by the demands of the particular science .
Hilbert 's formalism A major early proponent of formalism was David Hilbert , whose program was intended to be a complete and consistent axiomatization of all of mathematics .
Hilbert aimed to show the consistency of mathematical systems from the assumption that the " finitary arithmetic " ( a subsystem of the usual arithmetic of the positive integers , chosen to be philosophically uncontroversial ) was consistent ( i.e. no contradictions can be derived from the system ) .
The way that Hilbert tried to show that an axiomatic system was consistent was by formalizing it using a particular language ( Snapper , 1979 ) .
In order to formalize an axiomatic system , you must first choose a language in which you can express and perform operations within that system .
This language must include five components : It must include variables such as x , which can stand for some number.It must have quantifiers such as the symbol for the existence of an object.It must include equality.It must include connectives such as ↔ for " if and only if . "
It must include certain undefined terms called parameters .
For geometry , these undefined terms might be something like a point or a line , which we still choose symbols for.Once we choose this language , Hilbert thought that we could prove all theorems within any axiomatic system using nothing more than the axioms themselves and the chosen formal language.Gödel 's conclusion in his incompleteness theorems was that you can not prove consistency within any axiomatic system rich enough to include classical arithmetic .
On the one hand , you must use only the formal language chosen to formalize this axiomatic system ; on the other hand , it is impossible to prove the consistency of this language in itself ( Snapper , 1979 ) .
Hilbert was originally frustrated by Gödel 's work because it shattered his life 's goal to completely formalize everything in number theory ( Reid and Weyl , 1970 ) .
However , Gödel did not feel that he contradicted everything about Hilbert 's formalist point of view .
After Gödel published his work , it became apparent that proof theory still had some use , the only difference is that it could not be used to prove the consistency of all of number theory as Hilbert had hoped ( Reid and Weyl , 1970 ) .
Present-day formalists use proof theory to further our understanding in mathematics , but perhaps because of Gödel 's work , they make no claims about semantic meaning in the work that they do with mathematics .
Proofs are simply the manipulation of symbols in our formal language starting from certain rules that we call axioms.It is important to note that Hilbert is not considered a strict formalist as formalism is defined today .
He thought there was some meaning and truth in mathematics , which is precisely why he was trying to prove the consistency of number theory .
If number theory turned out to be consistent , then there had to be some sort of truth in it ( Goodman , 1979 ) .
Strict formalists consider mathematics apart from its semantic meaning .
They view mathematics as pure syntax : the manipulation of symbols according to certain rules .
They then attempt to show that this set of rules is consistent , much like Hilbert attempted to do ( Goodman , 1979 ) .
Formalists currently believe that computerized algorithms will eventually take over the task of constructing proofs .
Computers will replace humans in all mathematical activities , such as checking to see if a proof is correct or not ( Goodman , 1979 ) .
Hilbert was initially a deductivist , but , he considered certain metamathematical methods to yield intrinsically meaningful results and was a realist with respect to the finitary arithmetic .
Later , he held the opinion that there was no other meaningful mathematics whatsoever , regardless of interpretation .
Axiomatic systems Other formalists , such as Rudolf Carnap , Alfred Tarski and Haskell Curry , considered mathematics to be the investigation of formal axiom systems .
Mathematical logicians study formal systems but are just as often realists as they are formalists .
Principia Mathematica Perhaps the most serious attempt to formalize number theory was by the two mathematicians Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead .
They created a work , Principia Mathematica , which derived number theory by the manipulation of symbols using formal logic .
This work was very detailed , and they spent the better part of a decade in writing it .
It was not until page 379 of the first volume that they were even able to prove that 1 +1 = 2 .
Russell 's philosophy of mathematics was not formalist , however ; it is usually considered a form of logicism .
He strongly criticized Hilbert 's formalism .
Criticisms of formalism Gödel indicated one of the weak points of formalism by addressing the question of consistency in axiomatic systems .
More recent criticisms lie in the assertion of formalists that it is possible to computerize all of mathematics .
These criticisms bring up the philosophical question of whether or not computers are able to think .
Turing tests , named after Alan Turing , who created the test , are an attempt to provide criteria for judging when a computer is capable of thought .
The existence of a computer which in principle could pass a Turing test would prove to formalists that computers will be able to do all of mathematics .
However , there are opponents of this claim , such as John Searle , who came up with the " Chinese room " thought experiment .
He presented the argument that while a computer may be able to manipulate the symbols that we give it , the machine could attach no meaning to these symbols .
Since computers will not be able to deal with semantic content in mathematics ( Penrose , 1989 ) , they could not be said to " think . "
Further , humans can create several ways to prove the same result , even if they might find it challenging to articulate such methods .
Since creativity requires thought having a semantic foundation , a computer would not be able to create different methods of solving the same problem .
Indeed , a formalist would not be able to say that these other ways of solving problems exist simply because they have not been formalized ( Goodman , 1979 ) .
Another critique of formalism is that the actual mathematical ideas that occupy mathematicians are far removed from the string manipulation games mentioned above .
Formalism is thus silent to the question of which axiom systems ought to be studied , as none is more meaningful than another from a formalistic point of view .

Gary Richard Holman ( born January 25 , 1944 in Long Beach , California ) is a retired American professional baseball player .
A first baseman and outfielder , he appeared in 116 games over two seasons ( 1968 -- 69 ) in Major League Baseball for the Washington Senators .
Holman threw and batted left-handed , stood 6 feet 1 inch ( 1.85 m ) tall and weighed 200 pounds ( 91 kg ) .
Holman originally signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1964 after attending the University of Southern California .
The Senators acquired him in the first-year player draft then in existence , developed him in their farm system , and promoted him to their MLB roster in late June 1968 after 60 games in Triple-A .
Holman started in 13 games , ten as an outfielder , for the last-place club , and appeared in 30 contests as a backup to the Senators ' regular first baseman , Mike Epstein .
He collected 25 hits , including five doubles and one triple , and posted a batting average of .294 in 75 games .
As a result , he was named to the 1968 Topps All-Star Rookie team.But in 1969 , Holman struggled offensively , with only five hits in 31 at bats in limited service during the season 's first two months .
He was sent to the minor leagues in June , and retired from baseball at season 's end.As a big leaguer , he batted .259 with nine runs batted in .

Della Butcher was an art gallery owner and an avid patron of Singapore art , noted for her lifetime of work supporting Singaporean artists and making it an international name.She was born and raised in London , and studied art at London College of Art ( now Royal College of Art ) .
After her graduation from College in 1939 , she joined a fashion house as a designer , but did not stay with the house for long as she had disagreements with work ethics found with the management .
She tried her hand in auto racing but felt it was too exhilarating for her .
She joined the British Police Division in Reigate , Surrey at the outbreak of World War II .
becoming the first woman constable in the history of that county.When the War ended , Della took on various jobs such as a telephone operator , and as a stewardess on the Hunting Clan Airlines .
Being a wanderlust by nature , she was enthralled with flying to various parts of Europe and Africa and seeing different cultures and places .
She was especially fond of the life and culture of Africa.Leaving behind her flying days , Della took an office job as a manager for Skyways Aircraft Corporation in Cyprus in 1953 .
It was there that she met and fell in love with an archeologist doing field work in Cyprus .
She resigned from Skyways to become his assistant for six years .
Digging for artifacts excited her , and she kept everything she found .
When she had amassed enough artifacts she would organize an exhibition , arranging and showcasing them to interested parties .
It was her first foray into preparing art exhibitions .
When her archeologist boyfriend was promoted as the new assistant curator for the London Museum , Della decided to end the relationship as she in her words , " just could n't see myself working in the basement of the Museum for the rest of my life ... " She had moved on with her life which took her to Beirut in Lebanon working as public relations for the Alumni Association of the American University .
At the University she wrote art reviews for the alumni magazine , and was involved in organizing art and artifact exhibitions with the University arts group .
The exotic colors and excitement of life there captured every bit of her imagination , and she thought for sure it would be the last place that she would ever leave .
She chanced upon a lady in Lebanon and found out that she had owned a boutique in Jesselton ( now Kota Kinabalu ) in Sabah .
It was 1964 , and the lady offered her a position as a manager for her boutique in Jesselton .
Della saw the chance to see new cultures in exotic Asia , and agreed to take up that position.On-route to Jesselton , her flight stopped over in Singapore for two days .
During her stay , she searched around the island looking for art galleries and museums to visit .
She stopped by the Princess Elizabeth Walk near the Esplanade , and was captured by the beautiful creations on display by Singaporean artists Cheong Soo Pieng , Lee Man Fong , Chen Wen Hsi and Thomas Yeo for the first time .
She also realized these artists had no art galleries to represent and sell their works at all .
When it was time to leave for Jesselton she resolved to return to the island country to make a difference for Singapore artists , just as she boarded the Straits Steamship The Raja Brooke.Jesselton was a logging town , with a thriving community of white expatriate loggers and local Iban and Kenyah tribespeople interacting .
Often these tribepeople would emerge from the jungles with their traditional handicrafts to sell for money , and to buy tobacco and colored calico .
Della saw the opportunity to sell Iban and Kenyah crafts and jewellery by exporting these traditional wares to Singapore.Two and a half years later in 1967 , Della came back to Singapore once again .
She studied the local art market , and found that there was only the Donald Moore Gallery in Liat Towers which sold artifacts at that time .
She fell seriously ill , and had to be admitted at the Mount Alvernia Hospital .
Though in her grave condition , she had not forgotten her conviction for Singaporean artists and the will to open gallery to promote Singapore art .
She was certain that local artists had the potential to succeed as local expatriates were increasingly fond of Chinese artworks by Singapore artists , notwithstanding the lack of interest with art by locals seeking wealth and fortune in post-war Singapore.In July 1968 Della met Constance Meyer , an expatriate wife living in Singapore , and an avid collector of antiques and Balinese art .
They shared a passion for Singapore art , and Constance thought it was essential for Singapore artists to have a place to exhibit their artworks and where tourists visiting Singapore can buy from , in order to develop an international recognition for themselves .
Over the next 20 months the two women went into planning and action , searching for a good location to launch their gallery idea .
Their gallery , named the Meyer Gallery was officially opened on 17 March 1970 in an old shophouse next to Robinson 's Department Store on the corner of Raffles Place and Chulia Street .
This gallery was set up with help from the then-Minister for Culture Jek Yuen Thong , Minister for Finance Goh Keng Swee , the Chairman of National Theatre Trust Dr. Goh Poh Seng , the High Commissioner of Malaysia Dr. Lien Ying Chow and the US Ambassador to Singapore , Mr. Francis J. Galbraith.The new gallery sold both Singapore art , and tribal handicrafts .
Della later renamed her gallery The Gallery of Fine Art when her partner Constance left for Australia .
Running the business on her own , money became a constant problem for Della and often had to take on other freelance jobs like organizing film documentary sessions for multinational corporations , and designing and making 33 pairs of uniforms for Saber Air Private Limited within 3 weeks , just to keep it going and to support local artists .
Being new to the business , she also faced criticisms from other people - for presenting too many pictures at a show , for poor display and lighting , and for not providing proper catalogues .
These criticisms did not bother her , as she was more determined with getting buyers for Singapore artists .
She valued every exhibition space she can get her hands on , from busy hotel lobbies , to makeshift stalls on street pavements and the decks of luxury liners , and even driving around the island with paintings in the boot of her old yellow 1962 Morris Minor , just so that potential buyers can see the actual paintings and buy them .
On 21 November 1972 , a massive fire broke out at Robinson 's Department Store and caused inmeasurable damage to her gallery .
This forced to relocate her business to the Raffles Hotel .
Moving to the new location , she had to recover her losses and to pay her bills fast .
Thus she started buying flats , and renting them out to people to supplement her income .
She also exhibited Singapore art at the Long Bar and the Tiffin Room in the Hotel .
In the late-1970s , The Gallery of Fine Art was relocated to the Orchard Towers and it was here that Della made major headway to internationalise Singapore art.With each successful exhibition , Della become increasingly bold and creative in promoting her art business .
On January 1979 , she clinched a sponsorship from the Singapore Airlines to put up a series of art exhibitions featuring 150 paintings by 8 Singaporean artists - Ang Ah Tee , Nai Swee Leng , Ong Kim Seng , Tang Juey Lee , Tay Bak Koi , Wan Soon Kam , and sibling artists Henry and Karen Hoisington - in the Middle Eastern cities of Bahrain , Dubai and Kuwait .
The exhibition tour began in the city of Bahrain on 9 January 1979 , and lasted for 5 days at each city .
In spite of the fact that she had organized the show single-handedly , the touring exhibition received enormous success especially in the city of Dubai .
The Dubai Arts Society also had sponsored mobile screens to exhibit the paintings at the Dubai Sheraton Hotel .
She had not only sold 50 paintings in that city alone , the show had also helped to generate much interest in Singapore as tourist spot , by the locals .
Further to that the Society had also agreed to cultural exchange exhibitions with artists from both lands , in Dubai and at her Gallery in Singapore respectively in the following year.In 1982 , The Gallery of Fine Art opened a new branch at the newly opened Changi Airport .
It was claimed as the world 's first art gallery to be found in an airport .
The Gallery was unique as it had no walls , and the paintings were displayed on mobile revolving screens .
She also held exhibitions on board the luxury cruise ship , The Princess Mahsuri ( now known as Spirit of Adventure ) in 1984 .
Della 's reputation grew to be known as one of the first local art dealers who promoted Singapore art overseas , and to declare that Singapore art were on par with " international standards " .
UNESCO also noted her keen business sense , on their study of the Singapore arts climate over two occasions between 1980 and 1982 .
In the study of the Singapore art culture between 2 May and 8 May 1980 , Duncan noted Della 's uniqueness in making use of Mandarin Hotel 's premises to launch her ambitious series of exhibitions , in contrast to peer art galleries which normally had art exhibitions within their own premises .
In fact , this uniqueness went one step further in the 1986 Arts Festival fringe art effort held between 31 May and 15 June .
During the Festival Della showcased an exhibition of orchid paintings by Tang Juey Lee at the Hilton Hotel Music Room .
At the same time , an exhibition of Choy Moo Kheong 's paintings was advised to , and curated at the rival Low Pine Gallery in Ming Court Hotel , also as part of the Festival programme .
Though both Tang and Choy were represented by Della 's gallery , she had no qualms to Choy exhibiting with a competitor , and even providing aid to setting up the exhibition at the location .
This not only demonstrated flexibility in running her arts business , it also showed her generosity to work with , and share with her peers.Tang And Choy 's exhibition was the last show she had organized with the Gallery of Fine Arts .
With her poor health she ended the gallery business at the end of the Arts Festival in 1986 .
She returned to business again in 1988 with a new Della Butcher Gallery located in Cuppage Terrace .
Della Butcher Art Gallery at 39A Cuppage Terrace In the new location Della continued her championing work for Singaporean artists in the refurbished Peranakan house .
Though she is a businesswoman , she is clear that her heart for the business was never set on making money .
It was important to her that art is the heart and soul of nations , and thus a successful art gallery runs on strong passions for the art they represent.Though Singapore became increasingly affluent , she continued to fight perceptual challenges by locals that art is only for the rich and that buying art is an unpragmatic luxury that served no purpose especially during economic recessions , when people are more concerned about bread-and-butter issues .
She acceded that this perception was especially true during economic recessions and people would find art serving no purpose to them .
Even offices would just put up " economically-friendly " items to bring out the ambience of the place , during these hard times.That being said , Della advocated Singaporean art have their unique qualities and also represent good value for money , as compared to other art from similar establishments and values in Asia.Della 's hands-on approach in running her art gallery and her devotion to the artists she represents , continued to be her formula for success .
With her artistic experience and appreciation of the paintings ' unique personalities she would personally deliver and hang the paintings for her clients , to bring out the best for her clients ' homes.On 29 November 1990 Della was invited to be a part of a task force to look into the development of the arts industry and to develop it into one that can contribute to economic growth .
This task force , under the Economic Development Board 's Creative Services Strategic Business Unit ( SBU ) , composed of art experts from commercial and educational institutions , was to make a four-month assessment of the state of fine arts in Singapore , with particular emphasis on promoting and selling Singapore art .
The Mother of Singapore Artists In all the 24 years Della 's big heart was open to every Singaporean artist she had met and her larger-than-life personality was ready to reach out to more - artists or non-artists alike .
Stephens remembered her penchant for picking up strays and let them stay in her house .
And true enough , you would often find an eclectic mix of people living in her home on No. 1 Preston Road .
Whenever foreign artists visit Singapore , she would also gladly provide them with accommodation at her place.The name ' Della Butcher ' was never far from the memories of many Singapore artists and peers from her industry .
A rival gallery owner had nothing but praises for her indomitable spirit to help Singapore artists through the decades .
Whether it was in the 60s or the 70s when Singapore art was deemed unsaleable , or in the 80s when the Singapore art market was invaded by China art , Della stayed on with Singapore artists .
The late Cultural Medallion artist Ng Eng Teng attested to this unshakeable faith of hers , citing that she never gave up even when artists were relatively unknown to anyone and continued to push on with her beliefs despite growing competition from other galleries and during bad times .
Whenever artists faced financial problems she was always ready to give them money , and to buy their paintings to tide them over .
Watercolourist Ong Kim Seng remembered in his first exposure at a group artshow that Della organized , he was disappointed that he had not been able to sell a single piece of art .
He was overjoyed when he received a call from her the next day telling him that one of his paintings was sold during the show , only to find out much later in his life that the one painting was actually bought by Della herself.Indian woman artist Roopa Natarajan had a very successful exhibition by Della in 1991 , featuring the artist 's series of nude paintings and sold nearly all the 43 paintings ( 35 oils and eight watercolour paintings ) She was grateful to Della for launching her career in Singapore art circles and attributed much of that success to her.By 1992 Della had mounted more than 300 exhibitions involving 100 artists in Singapore and abroad .
As a tribute to her , 24 Singaporean artists who had all worked with her at some stage in their careers , held The Mother of the Artists exhibition in honour of her 70th birthday on 24 April 1992 .
It was held at the Riverwalk Galleria Exhibition Hall , and a 60 cm by 72 cm portrait of Della painted by Beijing artist Li GuiHua , was presented at the opening of the exhibition.Besides championing for the arts , her friends remember her for her sense of righteousness , and her willingness to fight for it .
Mrs Ros Lovell , owner of lifestyle shop Cho Lon in Holland village and Della 's neighbour remembered that she once spent several days chained to a tree , in order to protest and save it from being cut down .
Friends took meals to her in support of her cause , and eventually saved the tree.Della Butcher , died in her sleep on Monday morning at her home in 1 Preston Road .
Della Butcher Award In recognition of her lifetime commitment to championing for Singaporean art , Professor Tommy Koh had made a formal request to the Rotary Club of Orchard , Singapore to create an award and to be given to the best graduate painter from Lasalle-SIA College of the Arts in her honour .
This request was made on the formal installation ceremony of the Club 's third President , Professor Val Winslow on 15 June 1993 .
The trophy was designed by Temasek Polytechnic , with a S$ 2,000 prize money sponsored by Mastercard.The Club invited Lasalle to select five outstanding students with consistently high performances as nominees for the award , and presented to the best art student with the first Della Butcher Award at a closed-door ceremony in 1994 .
In 1995 , this Award opened its doors to 5 other nominated students from the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts ( NAFA ) .
But unlike the inaugural Award , all 10 nominees from the Academy and Lasalle were recognized for their unique artistic expression .
The fourth President of the Rotary Club Orchard Vijay Krishnan believed that recognizing a wide spectrum of artistic expression would be ideal in honouring Della 's spirit and her open-ness to supporting all forms of Singaporean art in her lifetime .
In 1996 , the Award continued to expand its recognition of art forms , and presented to a graduating art student from the National Institute of Education.In November 1995 , Friends of Della Butcher and the Club held an exhibition-cum-auction of Della 's personal trove of art prints and 75 paintings .
These works of art were by artist-friends like Ong Kim Seng , Tay Bak Koi , Nai Swee Leng , Prabhakara Jimmy Quek and Ang Ah Tee , and bought with Della 's own pocket as her support for these artists in their struggling years .
The total collection valued at S$ 87,000 , was displayed and auctioned at the Regent Hotel .
After the three-day event all the money raised was used to fund the Della Butcher Foundation , ensuring the Della Butcher Award can continue to be awarded to promising young artists .
At the same time , the Foundation had intentions to give out art scholarships for promising young artists in Singapore in the future .

The 2008 Speedway Grand Prix of Great Britain , known as the 2008 FIM Meridian Lifts British Speedway Grand Prix for sponsorship reasons , was the fifth race of the 2008 Speedway Grand Prix season .
It took place on 28 June , in the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff , Wales , United Kingdom .
The British Grand Prix is one of the four Super Prix events held in 2008 .
The winner in Cardiff will progress to the Super Prix final , taking gate 3 and the white helmet colour .
Riders Edward Kennett was nominated as a wild card after he finished 2nd at the 2008 British Speedway Championship .
Tai Woffinden and Simon Stead were the next highest finishing non-Grand Prix riders and both will be track reserves at Cardiff .
The starting positions draw was made on 18 June , at the FIM Headquarters in Mies , Switzerland .
Result Jason Crump from Australia was the winner of the British Grand Prix , he finished ahead of second placed Greg Hancock of the United States .
Crump therefore takes the white helmet colour in the Super Prix final.Nicki Pedersen benefited from controversial decisions by Polish referee Marek Wojaczek .
Pedersen touched the tapes in an early heat , which should have resulted in a mandatory exclusion but Wojaczek allowed the race to continue and later , after an innocuous clash with Leigh Adams on the first corner of heat 17 , Adams was excluded .
In the first semi-final Bjarne Pedersen , who led the qualifying scorers with 14 points , clashed with his Nicki Pedersen in identical fashion to Adams and he , too , was excluded , much to the anger of the 45,000 crowd.Great Britain ’s Scott Nicholls reached the final for the first time this year only to break the start tapes which resulted in his exclusion from the final .
Nicki Pedersen fell in the final and therefore scored 0 points from the race , but still took third place on the podium .
Nicki Pedersen still led the standings after the British Grand Prix , and it was the fifth time out of five Grand Prix that he had reached the final , although his first Grand Prix win in 2008 would not come until the following Czech Grand Prix .

The Solana Generating Station is a solar power plant near Gila Bend , Arizona , about 70 miles ( 110 km ) southwest of Phoenix , completed in 2013 .
When commissioned it was the largest parabolic trough plant in the world and the first U.S. solar plant with molten salt thermal energy storage .
Built by the Spanish company Abengoa Solar , it has a total capacity of 280 megawatts ( MW ) gross , from two 140 MW gross ( 125 MW net ) steam turbine generators , which is enough to power 70,000 homes while avoiding around 475,000 tons of CO2 every year .
Its name is the Spanish term for " sunny spot " .
Technology The plant employs a proprietary concentrating solar power ( CSP ) trough technology developed by Abengoa , and covers an area of 1,920 acres ( 780 ha ) .
Construction was expected to create about 1,500 construction jobs with the plant employing 85 full-time workers .
Solar thermal plants use substantially more water for cooling than other solar generating technologies .
Nevertheless , the Sierra Club supports the Solana plant , because it will be built on private land , and use " 75 to 85 percent less water than the current agricultural use . "
Economics Arizona Public Service ( APS ) has contracted to purchase 100 % of the power output generated from Solana , to meet the Arizona Corporation Commission 's ( ACC ) mandate that the state 's regulated utilities provide 15 % of their electricity from renewable energy sources by 2025 .
APS will pay about 14 cents per kWh .
The Solana plant was originally planned to open in 2011 and was estimated to cost $ 2 billion .
In December 2010 , Abengoa received a $ 1.45 billion loan guarantee to support construction of the plant .
Energy storage One of the principal advantages of concentrated solar thermal ( CST ) is that thermal energy storage can be provided efficiently , so that output can be provided after the sun goes down , and output can be scheduled to meet demand requirements .
The Solana Generating Station is designed to provide six hours of energy storage .
This allows the plant to generate about 38 percent of its rated capacity over the course of a year .
Production Solana Generating Station 's production is as follows.Projected full production is 944,000 MW · h ( 994 GW · h ) .
At the end of the second full year of operation , the Solana Generating Station is still operating 25 percent below the projected full production value .
Operations issues In the summer of 2017 , the plant had two transformer fires .
As a result , the plant ’s output was cut by more than half of its expected output for the year .
The Phoenix New Times described the state of the Solana plant as " problems keep appearing like black clouds to dampen its performance . "
The plant also went through some other challenging issues .
For example , Maricopa County environmental officials are looking into whether the plant violated air pollution standards .
In 2016 , Maricopa County fined the plant $ 1.5 million for violations of air quality standards .
According to the Phoenix New Times , " The plant ’s parent company , a subsidiary of Abengoa called Atlantica Yield , downplayed the issues , and a company representative said that better times are likely ahead . "
The plant opened in 2014 and has suffered a number of problems since its opening .
According to government documents , the plant should be producing more than 900,000 MWh every year .
This amount of electricity could power about 65,000 typical homes in Arizona .
However , the plant produced only 600,000 MWh in its first full year of operation , according to information from the Federal Energy Information Administration .
In 2015 , the output increased to 700,000 MWh .
In the summer of 2016 , a microburst " knocked out the plant that July . "

Sanford Gold ( June 9 , 1911 -- May 29 , 1984 ) was an American jazz pianist born in Cleveland , Ohio.Gold played locally in Cleveland and led regional bands before moving to New York City in the 1930s .
There he collaborated with Babe Russin and Raymond Scott in 1935 , and formed a trio with Dave Barbour in 1941 .
In 1942 he worked as a studio musician for CBS before serving in World War II from 1942 to 1946 .
After being discharged from the military , he worked with Don Byas , Mary Osborne and others before he went to work for CBS rival NBC , from 1949-1954 .
An album was recorded under his name on the Prestige label in 1955 , entitled Piano d'Or .
Gold was also a sideman with Johnny Smith , Al Cohn , Vic Dickenson , Coleman Hawkins and Sally Blair.Gold was one of the premier jazz piano teachers of his time .
His self-published book , " A Modern Approach to Keyboard Harmony and Piano Techniques , " distills the complexities of jazz and classical harmony down to a simple yet far-reaching system of pianistic and harmonic exercises , and has become an underground classic for serious students of the instrument .
One of his biggest fans was Bill Evans , who often steered students his way .

Tiger Man is a compilation from American singer and musician Elvis Presley consisting of tracks from his second comeback concert in 1968 .
Track listing " Heartbreak Hotel " " Baby What You Want Me to Do " Introductions 8pm " " That 's All Right " " Are You Lonesome Tonight ? " "
Baby What You Want Me to Do " " Blue Suede Shoes " " One Night " " Love Me " " Trying to Get to You " " Lawdy Miss Clawdy " " Santa Claus Is Back in Town " " Blue Christmas " " Tiger Man " " When My Blue Moon Turns to Gold Again " " Memories " Album Notes Personnel includes : Elvis Presley ( vocals , acoustic and electric guitar ) ; Scotty Moore ( electric and acoustic guitar ) , D.J. Fontana ( percussion with drumsticks on guitar case ) .
Presley 's friend Alan Fortas also provides percussion on a guitar case , with hands .
Lance LeGault is on tambourine , just off the stage , near Presley .
Compilation producers : Ernst Mikael Jorgensen , Roger Semon.Engineers : Al Pachucki , Mike Moran , Dick Baxter .
Recorded at NBC Studio 4 , Burbank , California on June 27 , 1968 .
Includes liner notes by Colin Escott .
Out of two small " concerts " Elvis Presley recorded for his " comeback " TV special on June 27 , 1968 , TIGER MAN is the entire second show and featured 7 previously unreleased songs.Audio Mixer : Dennis Ferrante .
Liner Note Author : Colin Escott .
Recording information : 06/27/1968 .
During the most captivating segment of Elvis Presley 's phenomenal 1968 television comeback special , Presley reunited with original band members Scotty Moore and D.J. Fontana .
( Bass player Bill Black died in the mid-1960s . )
To film that segment , Presley and the group performed two sets before a small , but rapt studio audience .
A generous selection of performances from those concerts became available on video in 1985 under the title " Elvis : One Night With You , " but RCA waited until 1998 to release TIGER MAN , a single CD of the performances .
Surely , most rock and blues music aficionados who have ever seen " One Night With You " will not need much convincing to buy TIGER MAN .
These performances quite simply capture Presley at his best , singing with a joy and fire absent from much of his 1960s output .
At the same time , Presley is clearly giving it his all , as if trying to undo in one brief set all the damage that years of safe , mediocre movies did to his image .
An unusual and stunning aspect is that Presley " swaps axes " - the electric guitar - with Moore early in the set .
Instead of Moore 's groundbreaking country-blues fusion guitar licks , we hear something completely new and unexpected .
Presley 's wild , thrashing , and incendiary rhythmic lead guitar playing reveals a side of Elvis Presley 's musicianship previously unheard on disc .
It is not something serious music fans want to miss , and it is displayed very well on this album.He had played the electric guitar live before , on a very few occasions .
And he played it on record both before and after the special.But there is no other recorded evidence of THIS kind of playing .
Moore is generous , giving his friend and bandmate room to shine , while he either gently fingerpicks or strums along with Presley , and Presley 's strumming friend Charlie Hodge .

The song " Rebel Warrior " appears on British musical group Asian Dub Foundation 's 1995 debut album , Facts and Fictions , and also on the group 's fourth album , Community Music , under a slightly different arrangement .
The song was inspired by the poem Bidrohi , translated from Bengali as " The Rebel " , and written by Kazi Nazrul during the 1920s .
Kazi Nazrul was a Bengali poet , patriot and composer during the end of the colonial era in India who supported Indian unity .
Nazrul wrote Bidrohi as a call to arms for those oppressed in India by the British and a call for unity between Muslims and Hindus .
The poem politically and metaphorically called for Indians to oppose British colonialism , by physically taking the government back and by mentally removing the imitation of British ideals and ideas from the country and returning to more traditional ways .
His poem was the first aggressive poem published against colonialism and it was immediately successful and popular with both Muslims and Hindus .
In his quest to unify India , Nazrul attempted to make Hindus and Muslims overlook their internal issues with each other and instead fight against the British .
Kazi Nazrul went on to write more poems , as well as the first Bengali protest music , though he was later arrested for his outspoken beliefs , becoming one of the most important men in the Indian independence movement.Asian Dub Foundation roughly translated the original text of Bidrohi on their track " Rebel Warrior " and used the song to support a modern take on Nazrul 's original stance .
The poem was chosen in part because of its significance to the Indian independence movement and because of its place in Indian traditional culture and its powerful and unifying lyrics .
It speaks out against neo-colonialism , both in England and South Asia , while also expanding the message to oppose modern racism in post-colonial England and the Western world in general.The lyrics , mostly taken from the original poem , aggressively encourage anger and resistance against the hegemonic West and call for people to stand up against racism by actively fighting the oppressor , even to the point of ending the Western empire .
This parallels Nazrul 's original message , in which he challenged people to stand up and battle colonialism by fighting back .
The song also says that part of ending racism is ending divisions between cultures , using the metaphor of the siren and flute and saying that these divisions exist only in the mind .
Asian Dub Foundation 's version brings the original 's message to a wider Western audience through its lyrics and modern hip-hop and South Asian infused sound , and acts to strengthen South Asian identity through its reminder of shared past struggles .

In linear regression , mean response and predicted response are values of the dependent variable calculated from the regression parameters and a given value of the independent variable .
The values of these two responses are the same , but their calculated variances are different .
Background In straight line fitting , the model is y i = α + β x i + ε i { \ displaystyle y _ { i } = \ alpha + \ beta x _ { i } + \ varepsilon _ { i } \ , } where y i { \ displaystyle y _ { i } } is the response variable , x i { \ displaystyle x _ { i } } is the explanatory variable , εi is the random error , and α { \ displaystyle \ alpha } and β { \ displaystyle \ beta } are parameters .
The mean , and predicted , response value for a given explanatory value , xd , is given by y ^ d = α ^ + β ^ x d , { \ displaystyle { \ hat { y } } _ { d } ={ \ hat { \ alpha } } + { \ hat { \ beta } } x _ { d } , } while the actual response would be y d = α + β x d + ε d { \ displaystyle y _ { d } = \ alpha + \ beta x _ { d } + \ varepsilon _ { d } \ , } Expressions for the values and variances of α ^ { \ displaystyle { \ hat { \ alpha } } } and β ^ { \ displaystyle { \ hat { \ beta } } } are given in linear regression .
Mean response Since the data in this context is defined to be ( x , y ) pairs for every observation , the mean response at a given value of x , say xd , is an estimate of the mean of the y values in the population at the x value of xd , that is E ^ ( y ∣ x d ) ≡ y ^ d { \ displaystyle { \ hat { E } } ( y \ mid x _ { d } ) \ equiv { \ hat { y } } _ { d } \ ! }
.
The variance of the mean response is given by Var ( α ^ + β ^ x d ) = Var ( α ^ ) + ( Var β ^ ) x d 2 + 2 x d Cov ( α ^ , β ^ ) .
{ \ displaystyle \ operatorname { Var } \ left ( { \ hat { \ alpha } } + { \ hat { \ beta } } x _ { d } \ right ) = \ operatorname { Var } \ left ( { \ hat { \ alpha } } \ right ) + \ left ( \ operatorname { Var } { \ hat { \ beta } } \ right ) x _ { d } ^ { 2 } +2 x _ { d } \ operatorname { Cov } \ left ( { \ hat { \ alpha } } , { \ hat { \ beta } } \ right ) . }
This expression can be simplified to Var ( α ^ + β ^ x d ) = σ 2 ( 1 m + ( x d − x ¯ ) 2 ∑ ( x i − x ¯ ) 2 ) , { \ displaystyle \ operatorname { Var } \ left ( { \ hat { \ alpha } } + { \ hat { \ beta } } x _ { d } \ right ) = \ sigma ^ { 2 } \ left ( { \ frac { 1 } { m } } + { \ frac { \ left ( x _ { d } - { \ bar { x } } \ right ) ^ { 2 } } { \ sum ( x _ { i } - { \ bar { x } } ) ^ { 2 } } } \ right ) , } where m is the number of data points.To demonstrate this simplification , one can make use of the identity ∑ ( x i − x ¯ ) 2 = ∑ x i 2 − 1 m ( ∑ x i ) 2 .
{ \ displaystyle \ sum ( x _ { i } - { \ bar { x } } ) ^ { 2 } = \ sum x _ { i } ^ { 2 } - { \ frac { 1 } { m } } \ left ( \ sum x _ { i } \ right ) ^ { 2 } . }
Predicted response The predicted response distribution is the predicted distribution of the residuals at the given point xd .
So the variance is given by Var ( y d − [ α ^ + β ^ x d ] ) = Var ( y d ) + Var ( α ^ + β ^ x d ) .
{ \ displaystyle \ operatorname { Var } \ left ( y _ { d } - \ left [ { \ hat { \ alpha } } + { \ hat { \ beta } } x _ { d } \ right ] \ right ) = \ operatorname { Var } ( y _ { d } ) + \ operatorname { Var } \ left ( { \ hat { \ alpha } } + { \ hat { \ beta } } x _ { d } \ right ) . }
The second part of this expression was already calculated for the mean response .
Since Var ( y d ) = σ 2 { \ displaystyle \ operatorname { Var } ( y _ { d } ) = \ sigma ^ { 2 } } ( a fixed but unknown parameter that can be estimated ) , the variance of the predicted response is given by Var ( y d − [ α ^ + β ^ x d ] ) = σ 2 + σ 2 ( 1 m + ( x d − x ¯ ) 2 ∑ ( x i − x ¯ ) 2 ) = σ 2 ( 1 + 1 m + ( x d − x ¯ ) 2 ∑ ( x i − x ¯ ) 2 ) .
{ \ displaystyle { \ begin { aligned } \ operatorname { Var } \ left ( y _ { d } - \ left [ { \ hat { \ alpha } } + { \ hat { \ beta } } x _ { d } \ right ] \ right ) & = \ sigma ^ { 2 } + \ sigma ^ { 2 } \ left ( { \ frac { 1 } { m } } + { \ frac { \ left ( x _ { d } - { \ bar { x } } \ right ) ^ { 2 } } { \ sum ( x _ { i } - { \ bar { x } } ) ^ { 2 } } } \ right ) \ \ [ 4pt ] & = \ sigma ^ { 2 } \ left ( 1 + { \ frac { 1 } { m } } + { \ frac { ( x _ { d } - { \ bar { x } } ) ^ { 2 } } { \ sum ( x _ { i } - { \ bar { x } } ) ^ { 2 } } } \ right ) .
\ end { aligned } } } Confidence intervals The 100 ( 1 − α ) % { \ displaystyle 100 ( 1 - \ alpha ) \ % } confidence intervals are computed as y d ± t α 2 , m − n − 1 Var { \ displaystyle y _ { d } \ pm t _ { { \ frac { \ alpha } { 2 } } , m-n-1 } { \ sqrt { \ operatorname { Var } } } } .
Thus , the confidence interval for predicted response is wider than the interval for mean response .
This is expected intuitively -- the variance of the population of y { \ displaystyle y } values does not shrink when one samples from it , because the random variable εi does not decrease , but the variance of the mean of the y { \ displaystyle y } does shrink with increased sampling , because the variance in α ^ { \ displaystyle { \ hat { \ alpha } } } and β ^ { \ displaystyle { \ hat { \ beta } } } decrease , so the mean response ( predicted response value ) becomes closer to α + β x d { \ displaystyle \ alpha + \ beta x _ { d } } .
This is analogous to the difference between the variance of a population and the variance of the sample mean of a population : the variance of a population is a parameter and does not change , but the variance of the sample mean decreases with increased samples .
General linear regression The general linear model can be written as y i = ∑ j = 1 n X i j β j + ε i { \ displaystyle y _ { i } = \ sum _ { j = 1 } ^ { n } X _ { ij } \ beta _ { j } + \ varepsilon _ { i } \ , } Therefore , since y d = ∑ j = 1 n X d j β ^ j { \ displaystyle y _ { d } = \ sum _ { j = 1 } ^ { n } X _ { dj } { \ hat { \ beta } } _ { j } } the general expression for the variance of the mean response is Var ( ∑ j = 1 n X d j β ^ j ) = ∑ i = 1 n ∑ j = 1 n X d i S i j X d j , { \ displaystyle \ operatorname { Var } \ left ( \ sum _ { j = 1 } ^ { n } X _ { dj } { \ hat { \ beta } } _ { j } \ right ) = \ sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { n } \ sum _ { j = 1 } ^ { n } X _ { di } S _ { ij } X _ { dj } , } where S is the covariance matrix of the parameters , given by S = σ 2 ( X T X ) − 1 .
{ \ displaystyle \ mathbf { S } = \ sigma ^ { 2 } \ left ( \ mathbf { X ^ { \ mathsf { T } } X } \ right ) ^ { -1 } . }

West County Center is a shopping mall located in Des Peres , Missouri , a suburb of St. Louis , originally built in 1969 .
The original mall closed in 2001 , and a new mall on the site opened in 2002 .
From the mid-1990s to 2007 , the mall was known as Westfield ( Shoppingtown ) West County and was one of seven St. Louis-area malls owned by the Australian mall company , until CBL & Associates acquired four out of five Westfield St. Louis malls in October 2007 .
In May 2011 , it was announced that TIAA-CREF would receive 50 % ownership of West County Center and several other CBL malls in an attempt to reduce CBL 's debt .
1969 mall The original mall opened on February 5 , 1969 at the southeast corner of I-270 and Manchester Road ( Route 100 ) in Des Peres , Missouri .
It was built on the site of the Manchester Drive-In movie theater , which many remember for the Easter sunrise services that were held there .
It was 563,621 square feet ( 52,362.1 m2 ) , and anchored by Famous-Barr and JCPenney .
The original mall closed on January 27 , 2001 and was demolished ( except for JC Penney which was remodeled ) 2002 mall The new West County Center , featuring 1,138,813 square feet ( 105,799.2 m2 ) , opened on September 20 , 2002 .
The US$ 230 million project added a 2-story Nordstrom , food court , and three parking garages .
It also included a 2-story Dick 's Sporting Goods above the café court .
In 2009 , the mall 's vacant Lord & Taylor was adapted into a new wing housing Barnes & Noble and other retailers .
The new mall has one of the city 's two Apple Stores and the city 's only Lego Store .
Dove sign The most famous part of the mall is the large dove sign that sits outside the mall next to Interstate 270 .
Created by Tony Amato , it has become a meeting place for thousands of people during its nearly 40-year life .
The removal of the dove in early 2001 caused minor controversy among nearby churches .
The dove was refurbished during the renovation , and in mid-2002 , returned to its original perch .
Today , it is in the parking lot outside of Nordstrom .

A shirtdress is a style of women 's dress that borrows details from a man 's shirt .
These can include a collar , a button front , or cuffed sleeves .
Often , these dresses are made up in crisp fabrics including cotton or silk , much like a men 's dress shirt would be .
As they are typically cut without a seam at the waist , these dresses often have a looser fit , usually relying on a belt to define the waist .
Button fronts and a forgiving fit make this a flattering look for most body types .
History Shirt dresses were sometimes called " shirtwaist dresses " when they were fashionable during the 1950s .
The 1950s version of the shirtdress was launched as part of Christian Dior 's post -- World War II " New Look " couture designs , with a full skirt held up by wearing a crinoline .
They often featured a notched collar , and elbow-length sleeves with cuffs .
More informal versions of the shirtdress , made of cotton , but retaining the full skirt and collar , became a staple part of many women 's wardrobes during the 1950s , with designers such as Anne Fogarty becoming known for their versions of this style .
A 1957 issue of Life magazine includes a photo of a typical cotton shirtdress selling for $ 25 in New York City.A variation of the original shirtdress is the " T-shirt dress " .
T-shirt dresses began being produced in the 1960s , and are simply an elongated version of a T-shirt .

Notes References
It has a large head , long nose , and a long round tail that can be longer than its body .
It is closely related to the blunt-nosed leopard lizard ( Gambelia sila ) , which closely resembles the long-nosed leopard lizard in body proportions , but has a conspicuously blunt snout .
The species G. wislizenii , once considered part of the genus Crotaphytus , is under moderate pressure because of habitat destruction but is categorized as " least concern " .
Etymology The specific name or epithet , wislizenii , is in honor of the German-American surgeon and naturalist Frederick Adolph Wislizenus , who caught the first specimen near Santa Fe , New Mexico .
Description The lizard has granular dorsal scales that can be white , cream , or gray with irregular brown or dark gray spots along its body and head .
Sometimes they have dark bars across their back .
The tail also has dark bars across it .
Juveniles have more highly contrasted markings compared to adults , often with rusty coloring on the back or bright red spots , and yellow on the thighs and under the tail.The male and female are different in appearance .
The female is about 15 cm ( 5.8 in ) snout-vent length , and the male is smaller , measuring about 12 cm ( 4.8 in ) SVL .
Both sexes are capable of marked color changes .
In its dark phase the lizard 's spots are nearly hidden and light crossbars become quite obvious on both the body and the tail .
In the light phase the opposite is true with the dominant color consisting of gray , pinkish , brown or yellowish brown hues .
During the mating season females develop reddish orange spots and bars on their sides and underneath the tail when gravid .
Males develop pink or rusty wash on the throat , chest , and sometimes the body , during the breeding season .
Distribution and habitat The long-nosed leopard lizard prefers to inhabit arid and semiarid plains growth , like bunch grass , alkali bush , sagebrush , creosote bush and other scattered low plants .
The ground can be hardpan , sand or even gravel with rocks that may often be used as basking sites .
Prefers flat areas with open space for running , avoiding densely vegetated areas .
From near sea Level to around 6,000 feet ( 1,800 m ) .
Its range includes the Western part of the United States from Oregon to Idaho in the north , south to northern Mexico in Baja California , Sonora , Coahuila , and Zacatecas .
In San Diego County , it occurs east of the Peninsula Ranges within the Lower Colorado Desert .
They are found in desert flats and lower foothills with little vegetation .
Behaviors The long-nosed leopard lizard is often seen on small rocks along the roadside , preferring direct sunlight when basking .
It is diurnal and has the potential to be active all day when the weather is mild to warm .
The daily activity cycle starts relatively early ( 05:30 -- 08:30 ; variation depends on location ) , and after a period of basking , long-nosed leopard lizards begin active hunting and feeding .
When in danger , it uses a defense mechanism known as " freeze " behavior , which means it runs underneath a bush , flattens its body against the ground and is motionless until the threat is gone .
If the case is extreme enough , such as capture , it is capable of caudal autotomy , or tail separation .
Its speed and agility are major contributors to its predatory success as well as its ability to evade predators .
When running at rapid speeds they run with forelimbs raised .
Feeding habits The long-nosed leopard lizard preys on small lizards , in addition to insects and sometimes rodents , like all members of the family .
This lizard also is cannibalistic , eating smaller leopard lizards when the opportunity arises .
On occasion , they will eat the young leopard lizards they hatch but the adults are usually not active during the time period that most young hatch from their eggs .
This allows the young time to grow and become more of a contender with the larger adults .
Its long nose usually makes its jaw quicker and better for catching vertebrate prey .
This species utilizes the stalking and ambush techniques when hunting .
As an ambush predator , it lays await in the shadows underneath a bush or small tree , where its spotted pattern blends , waiting for its prey to come within capture range .
When prey is sufficiently close , it uses a rapid pouncing movement to capture the prey in its strong jaws .
These lizards have been documented to jump up to two feet ( 60 cm ) in any direction , including into the air , in order to catch their prey . "
More than one leopard lizard has been found choked to death by the size of the prey it attempted to swallow . "
Some predators of long-nosed leopard lizards include a number of birds , snakes , coyotes , badgers , and the kit fox .
Reproduction The breeding season extends from May to June with a single clutch of 5 -- 6 eggs being laid usually in June or July , which hatch in the late summer months of July or August .
During mating no pair bond is formed between adults .
A single clutch is usually laid per year but in the warmer climates towards the south , it is possible for a female to spawn up to two clutches per year .
Birthing and egg-laying occur in an underground burrow , although no nest structure is formed .
Egg incubation is estimated to be between five and seven weeks .
Young emerge in August , when adult activity is coming to an end .
The timing of the juvenile emergence coinciding with the cessation of adult activity may aid in the prevention of cannibalism .
Conservation status The blunt-nosed leopard lizard is endangered .
It is no longer present throughout most of its former range as the habitat has been significantly altered by farming , urban development , overgrazing , oil wells , mining , reservoirs , and off-road vehicle use .
This habitat alteration continues .
However , there are no specific conservation concerns for the long-nosed leopard lizard .

Rashid Rana ( Urdu : راشد رانا ) ( born 1968 ) is one of the most important artists of his generation in Pakistan .
Rana has been included in numerous exhibitions in Pakistan and abroad .
He worked , over the past decade and a half , in dramatically different modes -- abstractions on canvas , collaborations with a billboard painter , photographic/video performances , collages using found material , photo mosaics , photo sculptures and large stainless steel works -- each time finding a freshness of purpose , and a surprising inventiveness of visual language .
Life Rashid Rana was born in Lahore , Pakistan .
He received a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the National College of Arts in Lahore , Pakistan in 1992 , and a Master of Fine Arts from the Massachusetts College of Art in Boston , Massachusetts , US in 1994 .
He is the head of fine art department and one of the founding faculty members of the School of Visual Arts and Design ( SVAD ) , Beaconhouse National University , Lahore .
Art career Rashid Rana has emerged as a leading name among the young-generation artists on the contemporary art scene .
He is known to develop a conceptually driven , well-informed art practice , which maintains a pixelated attention to formal concerns .
His works revolve around a subtle simultaneous exploration of media and identity -- both bound by a sharp political edge as he satirizes pop culture and looks to reinterpret varied elements of art and cultural history .
His new media projects are a visual commentary and parody of socio-political scenarios.Deftly traversing between the diverse mediums like painting , video , installation and photography , Rashid Rana has emerged as one of the leading artist of his generation , making his presence felt globally .
His work deals with everyday issues encompassing a wide range of themes from urbanization and popular culture to faith and tradition .
He often employs video installations and still photography .
A case in point is his series of composite photomontages in which each main image is constructed out of countless smaller photos of diametrically opposite subjects .
The viewer confronts a moment of sudden withdrawal after moving closer to the picture when one becomes aware of the several tiny images that constitute the larger one.It is the aesthetic concept of the grid deftly exploring the language of minimalism and geometric abstraction that serves as the precious connecting his monumental work to his mentor Zahoor ul Akhlaq.A foray into video art has resulted in seminal installations such as ‘ Meeting Point ’ ( 2006 ) in which the artist recalls anticipation from terrorism by projecting two airplanes facing and seeming to collide into each other , with the loud airspace audio.His recent international exhibitions include : Solo Exhibition , Lisson Gallery , London , Perpetual Paradox Solo Exhibition at Musée Guimet , Paris France ( 2010 , Where dreams Cross : 150 years of photography from India , Pakistan and Bangladesh , Fotomuseum | Winterthur , Switzerland , and Whitechapel Gallery , London , UK ; The Empire Strikes Back ; India Art Today , Saatchi Gallery ( 2010 ) The Power of Ornament , Lower Belvedere , Vienna ; Hanging Fire : Contemporary Art from Pakistan , Asia Society , New York ( 2009 ) , View Points and Viewing Points : Asian Art Biennial at the National Fine Arts Museum , Taichung , Taiwan ( 2009 ) , Re-Imaging Asia , House of World Cultures , Berlin ( 2008 ) ; Mirror Worlds : Institute of the Modern Art , Brisbane , Australia ; Beyond the Page : Contemporary Art from Pakistan , Manchester Art Gallery and Asia House , London ; 1st Singapore Biennale ; Grid < > Matrix , Kemper Art Museum , St Louis , US ; 5th Asia Pacific Triennale , Queensland Gallery of Art , Australia ( 2006 ) ; 3rd Fukuoka Triennale , Fukuoka Museum of Art , Japan , ( 2005 ) ; Playing with a Loaded Gun , Museum Fridericianum , Kassel , Germany.Dis-Location ( 2007 ) , a major solo in a range of media show of his selected works spread across two galleries including Gallery Chemould Prescott marked his return to Mumbai after a gap of three years .
Underlining the artist ’s importance on global art stage , an accompanying note mentioned : “ He has come to represent an entire generation of Pakistani Contemporary Artists .
Moreover in terms of the Indian art scene , he is the first artist from across the border to have been so thoroughly embraced since partition era artists such as Abdul Rehman Chughtai and Allah Bux .
Working both on major public installations as well as gallery based works , his art is now some of the most recognisable among artists from South Asia . ”
His importance in the context of Indian art scene is much beyond a simplistic cultural exchange .
On the international art scene , he represents the region as a whole , and he shares a deep connection with the country .
The artist had his very first international solo in New Delhi with Nature Morte in 2004 .
Looking back at those times , he had once stated : “ India was my launch pad .
I did n’t consider myself a professional artist till that show in 2004 .
It changed my approach . ”
He has not looked back since then , and has now become a poster boy for the Indian art gallery circuit .
One edition of his work " Red Carpet-1 " was auctioned at Sotheby ’s New York on 16 May 2008 , for a record price of 623,000 USD , highest price ever paid for a work of art produced by a Pakistani.The artist does not prefer to be tagged as a photographer , sculptor or video-artist .
He explains : “ I trained as a traditional painter , but I like the freedom to use any kind of medium .
I do n’t like hard divides . ”
In his work , Rana cleverly relates back to the history of art in Pakistan , his native country .
A graduate of the National College of Arts , Lahore , Rana deviated from his peers by moving into digital media and photography and away from the traditional painting techniques taught at the school.He writes ; “ In this age of uncertainty we have lost the privilege of having one world view .
Now every image , idea and truth ( may it be ancient or modern ) encompasses its opposite within itself .
Thus we live in a state of duality .
This internal conflict translates into my work , on a formal level , as well as having geographical , historical and political connotations . ”
Rana ’s ability to identify and exploit these tensions between the whole and its parts in his pointillist photographs has become his hallmark .
The artist is adept at pulling apart the world ’s facades , forcing his viewers to look beyond the larger image and to the sum of its parts .
In so doing , Rana reveals a litany of cultural , political and economic ills lying just beneath the surface of the carefully constructed representations we have come to accept as “ reality . ”
Although trained as a painter , Rana has recently turned his attention to various genres of new media art , including digital photography , installation , and video .
Nevertheless , the artist dislikes being defined only as a painter or photographer .
Not fond of hard boundaries , he prefers the liberty to choose for himself.Rana ’s work deals with everyday issues ranging from faith and tradition to urbanization and popular culture .
He uses photography and video installations to depict his commentary and parody of both social and political scenarios .
In his composite photomontages , for instance , each main image is made up of several thousand smaller photographs of diametrically opposite subjects .
There is a moment of sudden withdrawal when the viewer moves closer to the picture and becomes aware of the tiny images that compose the larger one.However , Rana 's formal and conceptual departure from this traditional style and medium is distinctly his own .
The stark contrast of the Muslim women in their traditional dress with the exposed nudity of the Western porn stars forces a powerful shift in focus between the poles of these two stereotypes and alludes to the great cultural divide between East and West .
Fascinated by how meaning is often misunderstood in our media-oriented society , Rana 's photographic practice cleverly creates images that offer an alternative view of how popular ideas and prejudices are created .

The painting collection is sold at auction , and the proceeds become her inheritance .
While wondering if selling the paintings was the right decision or not , a conversation with Keith makes her realize that Peg wanted Richard to know that she loved him .
She writes a letter to her aunt , letting her know that even though she never read the 13th envelope , she knows what it said .

RT Book Reviews praised Johnson 's originality , saying that she " puts an original twist on the genre and leaves some wonderful surprises for the end as well " .

The Farman HF .20 and its derivatives were a family of reconnaissance aircraft produced in France shortly before and during the First World War .
It was a refined version of the Farman MF .11 " Shorthorn " that did away with the type 's distinctive landing skids , and incorporated design features from Henri Farman 's designs .
It entered service with the French , Belgian and Serbian armies in 1913 ( two aircraft conducted reconnaissance during the Siege of Shkodër in the First Balkan War and one crashed ) , and with the British RFC and RNAS shortly after the outbreak of war .
The type was also licence-built in the UK by Airco and Grahame-White .
The HF .20 was seriously underpowered , and a variety of engines were trialled in the hope of correcting this , none with much success .
The problem was eventually solved only when an engine of twice the power of the original powerplant was fitted to the HF .27 variant , by which time the aircraft was already obsolete .
Nevertheless , the performance of the HF .20 made it adequate for use on secondary fronts .

Spaids v. Cooley , 113 U.S. 278 ( 1885 ) , was regarding a lawsuit brought to the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia on December 13 , 1876 , by Chauncey D. Spaids against Dennis N. Cooley to recover 593.70 , with interest from July 1 , 1868 .
The declaration contained the common money counts and nothing more .
There were two pleas , one denying indebtedness and the other averring that the alleged cause of action did not accrue within three years before the suit .
The plaintiff 's reply joins issue on the first plea and as to the second plea avers that the defendant promised to pay the debt named in the declaration within three years next before the commencement of the suit .
At the trial , the jury found " the issue in favor of the defendant " , and there was a judgment accordingly at special term .
The plaintiff appealed to the general term , which affirmed the judgment , and he brought the case here by a writ of error.It must be intended that the defendant objected to the admission of the deposition because of some alleged informality , but what that was is not set forth in connection with the objection ; nor is it stated what the informality was on account of which the court ruled out the deposition .
The deposition appears to be regular in form .
It was taken under a commission issued by the court , and executed by the commissioner named .
The interrogatories forming part of it were put and answered under a sufficient oath , administered before the answers were taken .
The answers are not in narrative form , nor in the form of an affidavit , but each is an answer to the specific interrogatory of corresponding number .
The place where the deposition was taken sufficiently appears .
The fact that there were no cross-interrogatories can not affect the regularity , because , under the order for the commission , made twelve days before it issued , and providing for the taking of the testimony " on the interrogatories and cross-interrogatories filed herein , " it was for the defendant to show distinctly that there were cross-interrogatories filed which had not been annexed to the commission .
In the absence of any apparent informality , if the objection made by the defendant to the admission of the deposition was made on the ground of an informality , that ground , to avail him here , should appear in the bill of exceptions , with a sufficient statement to enable this Court to see that the ground was a valid one , and the informality on which the deposition was ruled out should , to avail him , be stated in the bill of exceptions , with sufficient other matter to enable this Court to say that the identical informality on which the ruling of the court proceeded existed , and was good ground for the ruling .
As the defendant made the objection to the admissibility of the deposition , and it was excluded , it was incumbent on him to make it appear , by the bill of exceptions , what the ground of objection was , and that it was a valid ground .
The evidence , in the excluded deposition , as to the new promise , was material , and ought to have been before the jury , as tending to show an absolute promise by the defendant to the plaintiff , made within three years before the bringing of the suit , to pay to the plaintiff the money in question , as money then in the hands of the defendant , and due to the plaintiff .
As the direction of a verdict for the defendant appears to have been rested on the instruction that there was not sufficient evidence , to be submitted to the jury , of a new promise to take the case out of the statute of limitations , and as , if the jury had found that there was such new promise , there was evidence on both sides for the consideration of the jury on the other issues , under proper instructions , and the bills of exceptions do not purport to set out all the evidence on such other issues , a new trial must be had.The judgment of the court in general term is reversed , and the case is remanded to that court , with a direction to reverse the judgment of the court in special term , with costs , and to direct that court to award a new trial .

It was while here that he made his Oregon Trail sculpture .
Around 1925 -- 26 , he designed several bas relief panels , cast in bronze , for large doors of the United States National Bank Building , in Portland .
Fairbanks later became a professor at the University of Utah.He created a sculpture of the restoration of the Melchizedek priesthood for the Mormon Pavilion at the 1964 New York World 's Fair.Although most of his later work was free-standing sculptures , Fairbanks did return to the frieze when he made some for the Harold B. Lee Library on Brigham Young University campus.Fairbanks made a statue of Lycurgus that led to his being knighted by King Paul of Greece .
He also did multiple statues of Abraham Lincoln ( including The Chicago Lincoln ) and George Washington.He created the Pegasus sculpture in the northeast garden at the Meadow Brook Hall in Rochester Hills , Michigan .

Juan Ignacio Paulino Ramírez Calzada ( 22 June 1818 - 15 June 1879 ) was a Mexican writer , poet , journalist , lawyer , atheist , and political libertarian from San Miguel de Allende , then called San Miguel el Grande .
His father had been a prominent federalist politician .
In writings , Ramírez used the pen name , El Nigromante ( The Necromancer ) .
He defended the rights of Indians .
Ramírez worked with Guillermo Prieto to start the satirical periodical , Don Simplicio .
Ramírez is considered a member of the " ' romantic generation ' of Mexican liberals " coinciding with the Liberal Reform ; others were Ponciano Arriaga , Miguel Lerdo de Tejada , Melchor Ocampo , and Guillermo Prieto .
Birth and education Ramírez was born in San Miguel de Allende on 22 June 1818 , the son of José Lino Ramírez and Ana María Guadalupe Sinforosa Calzada Ramírez .
He began his studies in Querétaro , birth city of his father , and in 1835 was taken to the Colegio de San Gregorio in Mexico City , where he studied arts .
In 1841 he began studies and in 1845 obtained a law degree at the Pontifical University of Mexico .
He was admitted at age nineteen to the literary Academy of San Juan de Letrán , composed of the most enlightened men of the time .
Political life According to the website of the Mexican government , “ He was persecuted and imprisoned for his ideas , but managed to promote various changes to the law , such as that guaranteeing the autonomy of the municipality .
He was named Minister for Instruction and Promotion , instituting important educational and economic reforms .
During the reign of the Emperor Maximilian , he was banished to California , but on his return from San Francisco to the Republic following the ousting of the French , he was appointed to the Supreme Court of Justice as a magistrate.Ramírez criticized Benito Juárez 's re-election , and later the re-election bid of his successor , Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada , for which he was imprisoned .

He died 15 June 1879 in Mexico City .
Atheism Ramirez is famous in Mexico 's literary annals for his speech at the Academy on a topic so controversial that had the effect of a dynamite explosion : " There is no God .
Natural beings sustain themselves " ( " No hay Dios ; los seres de la naturaleza se sostienen por sí mismos " ) He was accepted despite protests that petrified the assembly . "
From this Ramírez developed the idea that literature should play a part in the progress of Mexican society and democracy . "
He championed the improvement of the situation of women in Mexico and extolled " education as the only possible way to achieve well-being . "
In the 1840s , Ramírez was involved with the Instituto Literario de Toluca , where he mentored the famous novelist Ignacio Manuel Altamirano.Long after his death , his atheism was the subject of a scandal in 1948 when muralist Diego Rivera painted a mural at the Del Prado Hotel with Ramírez holding a sign reading , " Dios no existe " ( " God does not exist " ) .
Rivera would not remove the inscription , so the mural was not shown for 9 years -- after Rivera agreed to remove the offending words .
He stated : " To affirm " God does not exist " , I do not have to hide behind Don Ignacio Ramírez ; I am an atheist and I consider religions to be a form of collective neurosis .
I am not an enemy of the Catholics , as I am not an enemy of the tuberculars , the myopic or the paralytics ; you can not be an enemy of the sick , only their good friend in order to help them cure themselves . "

Rosedale Golf Club is a private golf club in Toronto .
Founded in 1893 , it was originally located in Rosedale , Toronto at the site of the current Rosedale Field .
In 1909 , the course moved north along the Don River to its current site between the neighbourhoods of Teddington Park to the west , Lawrence Park to the south , The Bridle Path to the east and Hoggs Hollow to the north.The club has hosted several tournaments including the Canadian Open in 1912 and 1928 .
In more recent years , the club has elected to only host tournaments that cause little disruption to the membership .
The course record of 63 is held jointly by Greg Norman and former Rosedale assistant pro , Lorne Rowe.The present course was initially designed by the American designer Thomas Bendelow , but within a decade was re-worked by world-renowned golf course architect Donald Ross .
It plays to par 71 ( 73 for ladies ) and is 6,525 yards in length .
Each hole on the course is distinctive , with water in play on 9 of the 18 holes , big elevation changes and tight , rolling fairways .
Because of its exclusivity , Rosedale has not been played by many golf writers or professionals , and therefore does not appear on many of the golf course ranking lists ; however , those who have played the course rank it as one of the best " classic " golf courses in Canada .

Sir William Langhorne , 1st Baronet ( c. 1631 -- 26 February 1715 ) was the Agent of Madras from January 1670 to 27 January 1678 .
Family and early life William Langhorne was baptised on 26 July 1631 at St Gabriel Fenchurch , the son of William Langhorne and Mary née Oxenbridge.Langhorne was born in a well-off family .
His uncle Needham Langhorne left behind a vast fortune upon his death in 1673 , his favourite property being the manor of Newton Bromswold in Northamptonshire .
Langhorne was also a distant relation of first President of the United States George Washington.Langhorne 's father ( also named William ) was himself active in the East India Company , and had residences in Hitchin and in the parish of St Gabriel Fenchurch in the City of London.Langhorne entered Trinity College , Cambridge on 23 October 1649 .
After taking his degree he became a barrister with his admission to Gray 's Inn on 6 August 1664 but there is no evidence that he actively practised as a lawyer .
Following his father 's death he inherited stock in the East India Company , began to make money and was created a baronet ( in the Baronetage of England ) in 1668 .
Tenure as Agent of Madras Langhorne arrived in Madras in 1670 to adjudicate in a dispute between Sir Edward Winter and George Foxcroft .
A few months later , he was appointed as the Agent of Madras based at Fort St. George .
French siege of St Thome In 1670 , England under Charles II withdrew from the Triple Alliance and concluded peace with the French .
Hostilities broke out with the British taking the side of the French against the Dutch thereby triggering the Third Anglo-Dutch War.Hostilities were triggered on the Coromandel Coast when a French fleet of twelve ships of the newly established French East India Company commanded by Admiral De La Haye landed with three hundred men along the coast of St Thome and besieged the town which was under the sovereignty of Golconda .
In July 1672 , St Thome was stormed compelling the Sultan of Golconda to approach the British East India Company ( EIC ) at Madraspatnam .
The factors at Madras , who were Protestants like the Dutch , secretly nourished pro-Dutch and anti-French sympathies .
But the alliance that the British had with the French in Europe landed them in a dilemma .
William Langhorne , the Agent of Madras , despite his hatred of the French , chose to remain inactive.In the meantime , a Dutch fleet under Rickloff Van Goens , the Governor-General of Dutch India , laid siege to St Thome but were unsuccessful .
An engagement took place between the Dutch fleet of fourteen ships and a British fleet of ten ships on 22 August 1673 in which three ships belonging to the EIC were sunk.The French at St Thome who expected the British to help them against the Dutch were disheartened .
They strengthened their fortifications at St Thome and established a new camp at Triplicane thereby posing a direct threat to the British settlement at Madras .
The British held a consultation on 2 February 1674 , but before the authorities could come to a conclusion of the proposed course of action , news of the Treaty of Westminster concluded between England and Holland reached Fort St George thereby bringing hostilities to an end .
The French at St Thome surrendered to the Dutch on 16 August 1674 who in turn handed over the city to the authorities of the Sultan of Golconda thereby bringing the hostilities to an end .
Triplicane was liberated in 1672 and made over to the British East India Company at an annual rent of 50 pagodas .
Payment of tribute Despite its official existence as an independent entity , the Agency of Madras paid a tribute of 1200 pagodas to Neiknam Khan , the commander-in-chief of Golconda and later , his son Mirza Ibrahim Khan during the whole length of Langhorne 's tenure .
The Agency also paid an annual tribute to one Madan Pant who was the Prime Minister of Golconda .
From 1674 onwards , the Agency also paid a regular tribute to the Naik of Chingleput and Pallavaram who were regarded as " old friends of the Company " apart from Lingappa , the Naik of Poonamallee .
Hostilities with Golconda Around this time , Lingappa , the Naik of Poonamallee turned against the British when they refused to pay tribute .
He complained to Golconda on the arrogance of the British of Madras exhorting the Qutb Shah of Golconda to invade and capture Fort St George .
However , as the Qutb Shah was making plans to invade Madras the invasion of the Marathas consumed his attention .
Madras was spared from an invasion but restrictions were imposed on trade with the colony .
Trade of rice and corn were forbidden and Madras was required to present a thousand hundred yards of cloth along with an increased tribute.The Company yielded at once and presented Golconda as well as Lingappa Naik to appease .
The influence that Lingappa wielded increased manifold and he held supreme power between Armaghaum and Bijapur .
Religious tolerance According to 19th century historian James Talboys Wheeler , Langhorne was " far more tolerant of the religious opinions of others , than could have been expected in that intolerant age " .
He was reprimanded by the directors of the EIC " for firing your guns upon the naming of a church by the papists ; we can not approve thereof , and desire to give as little countenance and encouragement to that religion , as they do to ours ; and we would have you discountenance , and discourage all of our nation that any ways incline to that profession . "
Charges of private trade and recall In 1676 , charges of private trade were brought forth against William Langhorne by the Directors of the Company .
Major James Puckle who was sent to investigate the charges concluded that Langhorne was receiving an annual sum of 20,000 pagodas from an Indian merchant of Fort St George called Casa Verona ( Kasi Veeranna ) .
Both denied the accusations .
Other sources state that he had a private income of # 7000 a year , well above the # 300 allowed by the Company .
However , despite Langhorne 's violent protests he was recalled in January 1678 and replaced with Streynsham Master as the Agent of Madras .
Later life and death Langhorne amassed an enormous fortune through private illegal trade carried out during his tenure as the Agent of Madras and through trade with the Levant .
Having arrived back in England he purchased the manor of Charlton , Kent in 1680 .
This estate had previously been owned by William Ducie .
In 1707 he also purchased Hampstead , Middlesex .
His marriage to Grace Chaworth , the Dowager Viscountess Chaworth , a sister of John Manners , 1st Duke of Rutland made him one of the richest men in England , despite lasting less than year before she died on 15 February 1700 .
On 16 October 1714 he remarried to one Mary Aston .
He died on 26 February 1715 at the age of 85 without leaving behind any direct heirs to his fortune , his baronetcy became extinct on his death .
He is buried in Charlton Parish Church.Of his fortune , his will which was proved on 8 March 1715 , left at least # 1600 to be used in a similar manner to Queen Anne 's Bounty , providing increased income to the clergy of poorer benefices .
The Charlton estate was inherited by Sir John Conyers , bt , his sister 's son .
and the Hampstead estate by his other nephew William Langhorn Games and after Games ' death without male issue by a cousin , Margaret Maryon .

It was also during this time that an Office of Archives was established to maintain the records of the Agency .
The Council Room of Fort St George was allocated for this purpose .
This later became the Madras Record Office .
In 1909 , the office was shifted to Egmore and has since become the Tamil Nadu State Archives .
The Tamil Nadu State Archives is , therefore , one of the oldest record-keeping offices of the world and certainly the oldest such institution established by the British East India Company .

Condy Raguet ( January 28 , 1784 -- March 22 , 1842 ) was the first chargé d'affaires from the United States to Brazil and a noted politician and free trade advocate from Philadelphia , Pennsylvania .
Of French descent , Raguet was educated at the University of Pennsylvania .
After graduating he began studying law but had to give up his studies after the death of his father .
He briefly worked as supercargo for a counting house , before going into business for himself .
He later worked as manager or president for several companies , the most notable being the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society .
In 1816 Raguet read about the growth of savings banks in Great Britain and liked the idea ; he approached other Philadelphia business associates and together they created the Society , the first savings bank in the United States.As a member of the Federalist Party Raguet was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1815 and to the Pennsylvania State Senate in 1818 .
In 1821 President James Monroe made Raguet consul to Brazil .
After Brazil became independent , President John Quincy Adams made Raguet the chargé d'affaires to Brazil .
In this post , Raguet became increasingly frustrated with Brazil 's lack of response to complaints by the United States of its citizens being forced to work on Brazilian warships against their will .
Raguet 's communications with the Brazilian government became increasingly forceful and undiplomatic to the point that he once wrote to the U.S. State Department that he was so frustrated he could hardly consider the Brazilians a civilized people .
Despite urges from Washington , D.C. to improve his approach to Brazil , Raguet abruptly left the country after the Brazilian Navy seized a former U.S. warship .
Adams would later write that , despite having good intentions , Raguet 's " rashness and intemperance " nearly " brought this country and Brazil to the very verge of war . "
After Adams rejected any possibility of Raguet 's returning to diplomatic work , Raguet returned to business in Philadelphia .
Having his economic views shaped by the Panic of 1819 , he became one of the most prominent advocates of free trade in the United States .
He edited numerous journals relating to free trade and wrote and published works on the subject .
The most notable was On Currency and Banking ; published in 1839 , Samuel J. Tilden called it " the best treatise on banking ever published in the country " .
Biography Condy Raguet was born on January 28 , 1784 in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania .
Of French descent , Raguet was educated at the University of Pennsylvania and for eighteen months after graduating he studied law .
He had to give up his studies after the death of his father and became a merchant for a counting house .
In 1804 he was sent to Santo Domingo as supercargo for a ship .
He spent four months there and on his return he wrote and published A Short Account of the Present State of Affairs in St. Domingo .
Raguet returned for eight months in 1805 and again published a book about events on the island .
On December 23 , 1807 , Raguet was married to Catherine S. Simmons.In 1806 , Raguet went into business and soon became the president and manager of several companies .
During the War of 1812 he served as a colonel and took a prominent role in preparing defenses for Philadelphia .
In 1815 Raguet went into politics when he was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives as a member of the Federalist Party .
In 1818 he was elected as a state senator , a position he held until 1821 .
Philadelphia Savings Fund Society In 1816 , while president of the Pennsylvania Company for Insurances on Lives and Granting Annuities , Raguet read journals and pamphlets about the growth of savings banks in Great Britain .
Interested in the idea , he communicated the concept to some other businessmen he knew , and together they created the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society .
The first savings bank in the United States , the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society would eventually grow into a respected Philadelphia institution that would last until 1992 .
Raguet was active in the early workings of the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society , working on committees to set up company operations , drafting by-laws , and creating a charter .
In 1820 he submitted his resignation to the Board of Directors of the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society due to planned absences from the city .
Initially the board rejected his resignation , but after he stopped attending board meetings , the board accepted his resignation in July 1821 .
Other activities of Raguet included law , with Raguet being admitted to the Philadelphia bar association in 1820 .
At other points in his life Raguet was president of the Chamber of Commerce and a member of the American Philosophical Society .
As early as 1817 Raguet was also active in creation of a congregation based on Swedenborgianism .
Brazil In 1821 President James Monroe appointed Raguet the United States consul in Rio de Janeiro .
During his tenure , between 1822 and 1825 , he negotiated a commercial treaty with Brazil .
When the United States was preparing to formally recognize a newly independent Brazil through appointment of a chargé d'affaires , Secretary of State John Quincy Adams recommended Raguet for the post .
Despite urges to complete formalizing relations between the United States and Brazil , President James Madison did not appoint anyone before the end of his term .
Almost immediately after taking office , President Adams appointed Raguet chargé d'affaires to Brazil on March 9 , 1825 .
Raguet became the first chargé d'affaires from the United States to Brazil on October 29 , 1825 .
One of the first issues he dealt with was the blockade of Argentine ports by the Brazilian navy during the Cisplatine War .
Argentina was a growing trade partner of the United States and Raguet and his counterpart in Argentina worked to convince Brazil to restrict its blockade to only certain ports and that ships approaching the blockade should be given warning before being seized by Brazil .
After negotiations , Brazil restricted its blockade to only ports in the Río de la Plata , but the blockade still encompassed more ports than the United States was pressing for .
Brazil never made it a policy to give ships warning , but many ships were warned and let go.Relations between Brazil and the United States were strained over the recruiting of United States seamen for Brazilian warships through fraud and coercion .
United States citizens were enticed onto Brazilian ships and after the end of their voluntary enlistment period were forced to stay .
Raguet became exhausted with how the Brazilian government never followed up its promises to investigate the complaints .
The issue only got worse as United States merchant ships were seized by Brazil for attempting or intending to bypass the blockade .
The crews of the ships were often manipulated into Brazilian service or imprisoned .
Tensions over the issue continued to rise particularly after a US Navy commander , backed by force , procured the release of two detained Americans .
Eventually the Brazilian Navy ordered all ships to immediately surrender all improperly detained United States citizens .
Despite the order , Raguet was increasingly frustrated with what he felt was Brazil 's purposeful delay in processing detained United States ships and citizens .
After receiving approval from Secretary of State Henry Clay on his efforts , Raguet was emboldened and his notes to the Brazilian government became more forceful and undiplomatic.After a letter from a Brazilian foreign minister requested that Raguet use more moderation in his communications , he wrote to Clay that the Brazilian government was offended by his communications , that he had lost his patience with them , and that he hardly considered the Brazilians a civilized people .
By the end of 1826 copies of letters of Raguet 's communications to the Brazilian government had reached the State Department in Washington , D.C. Henry Clay wrote back indicating it would be best to use " language firm and decisive , but at the same time temperate and respectful .
No cause is ever benefited by the manifestation of passion , or by the use of harsh and uncourtious language . "
Responding to a request Raguet made to threaten to sever diplomatic relations with Brazil if they did not release their ships , Clay said " war or threats of war ought not to be employed as instruments of redress until after the failure of every peaceful experiment . "
By early 1827 relations with Brazil improved after a new foreign minister took office , but that quickly changed in March when Brazil seized the USS Spark , a recently decommissioned U.S. warship .
After a rebuffed offer to the sell the Spark to Brazil , the ship headed for Montevideo .
On the way , the ship was seized by a Brazilian man-of-war and its crew imprisoned .
Brazil demanded an explanation for what it said were irregularities in the Spark 's activities and suspected the ship was a privateer going to join Argentina .
Raguet did n't believe the Brazilians actually believed the Spark was a privateer , and felt that what he called " the most deliberate and high handed insult " against the United States was planned days in advance .
The incident with the Spark was the last straw for Raguet .
He sent a letter to the Brazilian government saying " that recent occurrences induce him to withdraw from the court of Brazil , and he therefore requests that his excellency will furnish him the necessary passports . "
He left his position as chargé d'affaires ended on April 16 , 1827 .
Once Washington found out that Raguet had left Brazil , the State Department quickly worked to appoint someone new to repair any damage caused by Raguet and to continue working on solving the issues with Brazil that had led Raguet to leave .
Adams would later write that relations between the United States and Brazil were " aggravated by the rashness and intemperance of Condy Raguet , ... [ who had ] brought this country and Brazil to the very verge of war . "
On Raguet 's return to the United States he held a meeting with Clay and Adams who said " I told him that my opinion of his integrity , patriotism , and zeal was unimpaired ; that I was convinced of the purity of his motives to the step he had taken ; but that I thought it would have been better if he had , before taking that step , consulted his government . "
When Raguet was suggested for another ambassadorial position in 1828 Adams felt that while Raguet 's motives were good he felt putting someone with " such a temper and want of judgment , who took blustering for bravery and insolence for energy , was too dangerous . "
In 1836 he returned to the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society where he worked until his death a few years later .
Raguet died in Philadelphia on March 22 , 1842 and was interred at Lower Burial Ground ( Hood Cemetery ) in Philadelphia .
Economic views Since the end of the War of 1812 , Raguet was a leading inflationist , supporting deliberate inflation through increasing the available supply of currency and credit .
However , his position changed after the Panic of 1819 .
The Panic also converted Raguet from a protectionist to a leading promoter of free trade .
While a state senator , Raguet sent a questionnaire to legislators and prominent citizens in each county of the state to determine the extent of the depression .
One of the questions was " Do you consider that the advantages of the banking system outweigh its evils ? "
Sixteen out of nineteen counties answered in the negative .
Raguet concluded that the depression was a result of bank credit expansion and the subsequent contraction as physical money was drained from the bank 's vaults .
He promoted restrictions on banks and of granting bank charters.After returning to the United States from Brazil , he became a publicist on free trade doctrines contributing to the Port-Folio and other periodicals .
He also edited several journals relating to free trade , including The Free-Trade Advocate , The Examiner and The Financial Register .
In the late 1830s he continued writing , authoring The Principals of Free Trade ( 1835 ) and On Currency and Banking ( 1839 ) .
On Currency and Banking , which was called " the best treatise on banking ever published in the country " by Samuel J. Tilden , was republished in Great Britain in 1839 and translated into French in 1840 .

Enchantress from the Stars is a young adult science fiction novel by Sylvia Engdahl ( published by Atheneum Books in 1970 ) .
It was her first or second book and the first of five set in the Anthropology Service universe ( 1970 to 1981 ) .
Its sequel The Far Side of Evil ( 1971 ) features the same heroine , Elana , and the two are sometimes called the Elana series , although the sequel is quite different in tone.Enchantress was a runner up for the 1971 Newbery Medal , the American Library Association award to the previous year 's best children 's book by a U.S. author .
It won the 1990 Phoenix Award from the Children 's Literature Association as the best English-language children 's book that did not win a major award when it was originally published twenty years earlier .
The award is named for the mythical bird phoenix , which is reborn from its ashes , to suggest the book 's rise from obscurity .
A new American hardcover edition was issued by Walker and Company in 2001 with a foreword by Lois Lowry and afterword by the author .
Next year it was a finalist for the Book Sense Book of the Year Award in the Rediscovery category .
Background Engdahl wrote parts of Enchantress in the 1950s ; many concepts in the novel date from that time , prior to Star Trek and other 1960s science fiction .
In a 1997 journal article , " Enchantress from the Stars : Sylvia Louise Engdahl , Star Trek and Science Fiction " , Carol Littlejohn writes that many of the themes and concepts in the novel ( such as the peaceful exploration of space without interfering in the history of other planets ) are similar to those in Star Trek .
However , the author notes that her characters take the rule of non-intervention much more seriously than does Star Trek 's crew of the spaceship Enterprise .
Plot summary Elana belongs to a peaceful , technologically advanced , space-faring civilization called the " Federation " , which monitors worlds which are still " maturing " , allowing them to grow without any sort of contact or intervention .
Elana stows away on a ship in order to accompany her father on a mission to a planet where intervention has been deemed necessary because a technologically advanced empire has invaded the planet in order to take advantage of its resources .
In order to lead a young woodcutter ( a native of that planet ) against them ( without exposing him to the truth about either alien civilization ) Elana takes on the role of an enchantress .
She gives him various tools , leading him to believe that they are magical .

Blue Light is a science fiction novel written by Walter Mosley in 1998 .
The book was published in 1998 by Little Brown & Co. .
Plot Summary In 1965 , a mysterious beam of blue light came down from space and overlooked Northern California .
This light had extraterrestrial powers that caused whomever the beam touched to die , go mad , or acquire a special unique power .
This power is defined as full actualization of humankind , with strengths , understandings and communication abilities that exceed our normal capabilities .
The people touched by the light in the novel were soon referred to as " Blues " and were segregated from society because of their new and improved super human powers .
Soon after this discovery , they came together to try to find their purpose in the universe .
As they look for their calling in life , an evil force , the " Gray Man " , emerges , setting the stage for a battle later on in the novel between good and evil .
The Gray Man is Horace LaFontaine , a character in the novel who was struck by the light at the moment of his death .
He was revivified as a demon sent to kill all of the " blues " .
Once the " blues " discover this nemesis , they take refuge in the forest outside of Northern California .
Soon , the Gray Man finds out where they are hiding from inside sources and the " blues " come to a consensus in which they are going to confront their enemy and declare war with the Gray Man .
This epic battle takes place at the ending of the novel and has an extraordinary finish .
The " blues " all use their powers that they were given to destroy the Gray Man .
They soon reside in the small cities of Northern California and live normal lives with the people of California .
Main Characters Chance : narrates the story , also a " Blue " that has the power of visionClaudia : A female " Blue " that has the power to make men lust after herWinch Fargo : A murderer who is only partially struck by the lightOrde : leader and teacher of the " blues " Horace LaFontaine : dies from cancer at the moment he is struck by light , becomes the embodiment of death.Juan Thrombone : a figure reminiscent of Carlos Castaneda 's Native American mystic Don Juan Reception Blue Light received mostly positive reviews and it was described as a good read .
While many of the reviews were written by science fiction fans , there was one favorable review from the New York Times , which stated that , " The fuel that energizes the novel is not its characters but its plot ... " , which means that the novel has a good background and it is an enjoyable read .
SF Signal refers to the novel as " an excellent , well-told , page-turning horror/fantasy hybrid " .
The reviews also compared this novel to his other famous books the Devil in a Blue Dress and Futureland : Nine Stories of an Imminent World .
Many critics point out that the story resembles racism and how the " blues " overcome what African Americans have overcome today .
Only one critic felt that the racism was a negative aspect of the novel saying " ... the racism in the novel is n't needed ... " .
Critics have viewed this novel differently over the years but they seem to be consistent when they rate the novel .
The reviews give the book anywhere from three to five stars with only one critic giving the novel a two out of five .

Dobcross is a village in Saddleworth -- a civil parish of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham , and since 1974 part of the administrative county Greater Manchester , England .
It is located in a valley in the South Pennines , along the course of the River Tame and the Huddersfield Narrow Canal , 4.2 miles ( 6.8 km ) east-northeast of Oldham and 13 miles ( 21 km ) west-southwest of Huddersfield.Historically and culturally a part of the West Riding of Yorkshire , Dobcross was anciently a chapelry in the Quickmere division of Saddleworth .
For centuries , Dobcross was a hamlet , sustained by domestic flannel and woollen cloth production .
Many of the original 17th and 18th century barns and weavers ' cottages survive today as listed buildings.Together with neighbouring Delph , Dobcross is , geographically , " considered as the centre of Saddleworth " , although is not its largest village centre by some margin .
Industrial tycoon Henry Platt was born in Dobcross in 1770 .
John Schlesinger 's 1979 film Yanks was filmed on location in Dobcross , and an annual Yanks festival , coupled with a brass band contest on Whit Friday , each contribute to the village 's cultural calendar .
History Dobcross is located at an ancient crossing point of the River Tame which was formerly used by trans-Pennine packhorses as they travelled east from Lancashire into Yorkshire .
Thus the name meaning the place where horses cross.At this crossing point of the River Tame lies the site of Walk Mill , which derives its name from the way the wool was ' walked ' or trodden to ' full ' the cloth before the introduction of mechanical stocks by which the cloth was beaten with fulling hammers to felt and thicken it .
Probably the earliest fulling mill in Saddleworth , Walk Mill would have been a common meeting place for the local clothiers.Beginning with Richard , the Lawton family ran the mill from at least the late 16th century , if not earlier , and their later wealth in buildings , land and money probably came from the monopoly held by the fulling mill in finishing locally made cloth .
The size of the business can be estimated in that by 1792 Saddleworth saw the production of 36,637 cloth pieces , each priced at # 7 , giving a total revenue of # 256,459 ( equivalent to # 28,660,000 in 2016 ) .
A total of 1,480,000 pounds ( 740 short tons ) of wool had been used in their manufacture .
From wool to the innkeeping business , the Lawton family continued to be a prominent family in Dobcross through to the early 19th century.On the morning of Whit Friday , the traditional Whit Walks , a church procession followed by a service , take place in Saddleworth parish .
Saddleworth and District Whit Friday Brass Band contests take place every year on the afternoon and evening of Whit Friday.The playwright Henry Livings ( 1929 -- 1998 ) lived in the village and a Henry Livings Memorial Prize is open to bands who have played on any of the morning 's walks.A public house " the Nudger " in the village was once owned by the Olympic swimming champion Henry Taylor of Oldham .
Governance Lying within the ancient county boundaries of Yorkshire since a very early time , during the Middle Ages , Dobcross lay within the Saddleworth chapelry of the ancient parish of Rochdale .
Like the other Yorkshire areas of the ancient parish , it was in the wapentake of Agbrigg , with the Lancashire areas of the ancient parish being in Salfordshire.Dobcross was created an ecclesiastical parish in 1797 .
It is currently in Saddleworth Deanery , part of the Archdeaconry of Rochdale , in the Anglican Diocese of Manchester.From 1894 to 1900 , Dobcross lay within the Saddleworth Rural District , a local government district in the administrative County of York , West Riding .
In 1900 , Dobcross was merged into Saddleworth Urban District , where it stayed until 1974 .
Under the Local Government Act 1972 , the Saddleworth Urban District was abolished , and Dobcross has , since 1 April 1974 , formed part of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham , within Greater Manchester.Since 1997 , Dobcross has formed part of the parliamentary constituency of Oldham East and Saddleworth , and is represented in the House of Commons by Debbie Abrahams , a member of the Labour Party .
Between 1983 and 1997 it was in the Littleborough and Saddleworth constituency .
Demography The villages of Dobcross and Uppermill were treated as a single entity by the Office for National Statistics in the 2001 United Kingdom Census .
As such , there are no demographic statistics for the village on its own .
The statistics given here are for the combined population of Dobcross and Uppermill , which are about half a mile apart.At the 2001 census , the area had a population of 7,475 .
Its population density was 10,324 inhabitants per square mile ( 3,986 / km2 ) , with a female-to-male ratio of 100 to 92.6 .
Of those over 16 years old , 22.5 % were single ( never married ) , 49.6 % married , and 7.8 % divorced .
The 3,225 households in the area included 27.7 % one-person , 43.2 % married couples living together , 8.1 % were co-habiting couples , and 6.9 % single parents with their children .
Of those aged 16 -- 74 , 21.1 % had no academic qualifications , significantly below the averages of Oldham ( 37.7 % ) and England ( 28.9 % ) .
At the 2001 UK census , 79.6 % of residents in the area reported themselves as being Christian , 0.3 % Muslim , 0.3 % Hindu , 0.2 % Buddhist , and 0.2 % Jewish .
The census recorded 13.3 % as having no religion , 0.2 % had an alternative religion and 6.0 % did not state their religion .
Transport Dobcross railway station closed in 1955 when the Delph Donkey passenger train service from Oldham to Delph via Greenfield was withdrawn .
The line remained in use for goods traffic until 1963 .
The main bus route through the village of Dobcross is the 184 , operated by First Greater Manchester .
This runs twice an hour to Diggle and Huddersfield , and in the opposite direction to Oldham and Manchester .
On the hourly service to and from Huddersfield , it avoids the village by taking a quicker route along Wool Road , lying just to the east of the village .
The other services through Dobcross Square are the 353 and 354 which run from Denshaw and Carrcote to Ashton-under-Lyne .
These each run every two hours Monday to Saturday , and are run by First .
There are no evening or Sunday services through Dobcross Square.Besides the services through the village proper , First services 82 ( Uppermill - Manchester , peak hours only ) , 350 ( Ashton - Oldham , every 30 minutes ) and X84 ( Carrcote - Manchester , peak hours only ) serve Dobcross New Road .

However , the show made no mention of Columbia or the Pulitzer School of Journalism .
Productions and performers Plays in the first season included You Ca n't Take It with You ( the initial telecast ) , The Magnificent Ambersons and Our Town .
The second season productions included Ah , Wilderness and The Skin of Our Teeth .
Actors in these shows included Spring Byington , Charles Dingle , James Dunn , Nina Foch , John Forsythe , Helen Hayes , Wanda Hendrix , Wright King , Otto Kruger , Joan McCracken , Thomas Mitchell , Mildred Natwick , Gene Raymond , Kent Smith and Fredd Wayne .
Lighting design was by Imero Fiorentino .
The announcer was Nelson Case .
A brewing problem The series began October 6 , 1950 , and a month later it came under criticism from the Woman 's Christian Temperance Union , which objected to the tie-in between Schlitz and the Pulitzer Prize .
Mrs. D. Leigh Colvin , president of the WCTU , suggested that Columbia should return the $ 100,000 , stating that the program was " a scheme of education for alcoholism which uses American classics as a springboard for beer promotion .
The tie-up ... allies the university , its school and the Pulitzer name with programs which are obviously put on by the brewer to promote drinking in the American home .
Beer bottles and beer drinking have been rampant in commercials between acts , one recent commercial depicting Mona Lisa coming to life from her painting to reach for a glass of the sponsor 's beer . "
Dean Carl W. Ackerman of the Pulitzer School responded , " This has been a pioneering development in the relationship between industry and education .
It is raising the standards of entertainment in American homes .
Any development which contributes to the improvement of home life is wholesome because the home is the bulwark of democracy . "
Schlitz president Erwin C. Uilein pointed out that Vassar College was founded in 1861 by Matthew Vassar who had made a fortune in his Poughkeepsie , New York brewery .
Graphic design and formats The opening title card displayed a painted design of comedy/tragedy masks with a quill pen positioned in the mouth of the tragedy mask .
Advertising for the series also used comedy/tragedy masks but in a more simplified line-art version minus the quill pen.The series was telecast live , but in some areas it was shown two weeks later as captured on kinescope film .
It initially presented hour-long dramas from October 1950 to June 1951 ; the series was reduced to a 30-minute format from December 1951 to June 1952 .
During the second season , the series alternated with Celanese Theater .
Pulitzer Prize Playhouse continued until June 4 , 1952 , producing a total of 53 episodes .

Biography Layla Rose Hanbury was born 5 October 1982 .
In 2000 Layla 's first gig was at an MC battle where she was the only female among 20 entrants .
Layla is a member of the Syllaboliks ( SBX ) Crew with other Australian MCs and hip hop acts : Drapht , Matty B , Dazastah , Hunter , Downsyde , and Clandestien .

The following year she issued a track , " Its Only Me " , on the Obese Records 2 × CD compilation album , Culture of Kings Volume 2 .
In 2003 Layla was one of six artists interviewed for the VHS , All the Ladies , describing " what it is like to be a female MC in the Australian underground hip hop scene " .
Film footage included live performances from an earlier gig , Short 'n' Sweet , organised by fellow hip hop artist , A-Love ( aka Antonella Formosa ) .

The lyrics relate to female artists , exemplified by Britney Spears , who sexualise their performances and give young girls a poor example .
Reutens also produced , mixed and recorded the album.Her music is defined by her forceful and candid lyrics that range from her frustrations with female recording artists using their bodies to sell music in " The Fuss About Sluts " , to an exploration of her own creative practices in " Driving Miss Layzy " .
In the Mix website 's Sophiska described Heretik 's tracks , which " range from straight up hip hop battle jams ... to more reflective , instrumental composition ... The remainder are very theme dependant , ' Driving Miss Layzy ' employs more of a light-hearted funk , soul formula to compliment rhymes about laying back and procrastinating " .

Fesdis is a town in north-eastern Algeria .
Huma Mulji ( born 1970 in Karachi ) is an artist based in Lahore , Pakistan .
Her sculpture and photography discuss identity through the metaphor of travel and the freedom it affords for self-exploration .
Life Huma Mulji was born in Karachi , Pakistan , in 1970 , and completed her Bachelors in Fine Art from the Indus Valley School of Art and Architecture in 1995 .
Mulji 's participation in recent selected exhibitions includes in 2008 Farewell to Post Colonialism , Third Guangzhou Triennial , Guangdong Museum of Art , China ; Desperately Seeking Paradise , Pakistan Pavilion , ART DUBAI , UAE and Arabian Delight , Rohtas Gallery , Lahore .
Art career Huma Mulji 's work has moved more and more towards looking at the absurdities of a post-colonial society in transition , taking on board the visual and cultural overlaps of language , image and taste , that create the most fantastic collisions .
She describes the time we live in as moving at a remarkable speed and in regard to Pakistan Mulji refers to the experience of ' living 200 years in the past and 30 years in the future all at once ' .
She is interested in looking at this phenomenon with humor , to recognize the irony of it , formally and conceptually .
Rather than dwell on and follow existing theoretical issues of living and working in a post-colonial nation , and applying those stagnant studies to a lived existence she examines the pace of cultural change through her art work.Mulji 's sculptural works respond to the possibilities of making things in Pakistan , and embrace low-tech methods of “ making ” , together with materials and forms that come from another time , and that are “ imported ” , “ newly discovered ” or “ re-appropriated ” .
For example , the work Arabian Delight is a low-tech taxidermy camel , stuffed in a suitcase .
It plays with ideas of travel , transition , and of mental and physical movement , combined with an old world symbol of the camel , forced into the suitcase , looking formally uncomfortable , but nonetheless happy .
This particular work also examines the relationship between Pakistan and the Gulf States and the manipulation of the Governments of Pakistan , the “ Arabisation ” of the country , for years , towards all but wiping out a “ south Asian ” identity , to replace it with a “ Muslim ” identity .
For Mulji , this in itself , is forced , unnatural , and disagreeable .
However , she also approaches this problem from the angle of someone living within it : therefore looking at it with humor , and recognizing the absurd results of the situation , in daily life , and through interactions with each other , and the world.The photographic series Sirf Tum ( only you ) from 2004 and from 2008 , similarly address such absurd collisions .
Sirf Tum deals with issues related to intimacy in public spaces .
Surveying the frame through the lens , the camera zooms in , becoming the voyeur , awkwardly , confidently , watching and disapproving at once .
The protagonists are secondhand dolls bought from piles of toys sold around Lunda Bazaar in Lahore , incidentally brought into Pakistan with Salvation Army clothing from another world , left over from some child ’s summer holiday .
Already on the periphery of society , the naked couple is placed in locales that challenge and are challenged by their scale , creating a hyper-real space , a hyper-real narrative , a “ plastic ” story , convincing and disturbing at the same time .
In the 2008 series , the two seemingly interactive narratives engage with each other visually , but do n’t really converse .
Which of the narratives is real ?
This also brings into question contemporary media images , and the phenomenon of “ photoshop ” , where the fine line between truth and untruth becomes a matter of belief.She teaches at Beaconhouse National University in Pakistan .

Richard Woodward ( 1726 -- 12 May 1794 ) was Bishop of Cloyne in the Church of Ireland and the author of a vigorous defence of the Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland .
Origins and education Richard Woodward was the son of Francis Woodward , of Grimsbury , near Bristol .
He was educated by Josiah Tucker , the Dean of Gloucester , before attending Wadham College , Oxford , where he took the degree of Bachelor of Civil Law in 1749 and Doctor of Civil Law in 1759 .
Career Between 1764 and 1781 Woodward was Dean of Clogher and between 1772 and 1778 he was Chancellor of St. Patrick 's Cathedral , Dublin .
In May 1778 he exchanged the latter position for the rectory of Louth .
In 1781 he was raised to the episcopy as Bishop of Cloyne , being consecrated on 4 February 1781 at Christ Church Cathedral , Dublin , by the Archbishop of Dublin and the Bishops of Ossory and Clonfert .
He continued to serve as Bishop of Cloyne until his death on 12 May 1794 .
Works and writings Richard Woodward ’s best known work was The Present State of the Church of Ireland , Containing a Description of it ’s [ sic ] Precarious Situation ; and the Consequent Danger to the Public , Recommended to the Serious consideration of the Friends of the Protestant Interest , to which are Subjoined , Some Reflections on the Impracticability of a Proper Commutation of Tithes ; and a General Account of the Origin and Progress of the Insurrection in Munster ( Dublin : W. Sleater 1787 ) , the subject matter of which is sufficiently delineated in its title .
It proved a controversial and successful tract , running rapidly through seven editions and “ evinced the force of the author ’s arguments , by the violent enmity which it excited against him in all the enemies of the Church ” .
Both the controversy and the success may be explained in part by such sentences as : “ I need not tell the Protestant proprietor of land , that the security of his title depends very much ( if not entirely ) on the Protestant ascendancy ; or that the preservation of that ascendancy depends entirely on an indissoluble connection between the Sister Kingdoms . ”
Richard Woodward could not , however , be easily dismissed as a bigot .
As his memorial in his cathedral church records , “ He was an eloquent and distinguished Advocate in the House of Peers for the Repeal of the Roman Catholic Penal Statutes in 1782 ” .
Woodward also took a keen interest in the plight of the Irish poor and , while Dean of Clogher , wrote both An Argument in support of the Right of the Poor in Ireland to a national Provision ( Dublin , 1772 ) and An Address to the Public on the Expediency of a regular Plan for the Maintenance and Government of the Poor ( Dublin , 1775 ) .
His memorial records that he planned and was in 1773 the principal Institutor of the House of Industry in Dublin.He also published a Charge delivered to the Clergy at the Visitation in July , 1793 ( Cork , 1793 ) .
According to John Wesley , who attended a service in the church at Clogher in 1771 , where “ the congregation was not only large , but remarkably well-behaved ” , Woodward was one of the best readers he had heard and “ one of the most easy , natural preachers ” .
Family On 3 October 1763 , Woodward married Susanna ( d. 11 May 1795 ) , the daughter of Richard Blake , of Bristol .
Among their children , Richard ( d. 1828 ) also entered the Church , becoming prebendary of Inniscarra in 1798 , and Mary ( 1767 -- 1799 ) married the Hon. Charles Brodrick , Archbishop of Cashel .

Charles Allen Prosser ( 1871 -- 1952 ) was the Father of Vocational Education in the United States and the architect of the 1917 Smith-Hughes Act .
His mission in life was to help improve the education of American children .
Biography Charles Allen Prosser was born the son of a steel worker on September 20 , 1871 in New Albany , Indiana.He attended DePauw University in 1897 and 1906 , where he received his B.A. and M.A. degrees .
He also attended the University of Louisville where he received a L.L.B. degree .
His Ph.D. was from Columbia University .
Prosser also received many honorary degrees from several other universities in the United States.Charles Allen Prosser taught physics and history at the old New Albany High School .
He later served as Superintendent of the local school district from 1900 until 1908 .
During this time he improved the old instruction system by streamlining many regular activities , he upgraded the required teacher qualifications , under his administration he built the then new high school located at E. 6th and Spring Streets , he assisted the city in obtaining the present library , and also instituted the city 's first night school program .
Prosser was president of the Indiana Teachers Association for several years while living in Indiana.For several years Prosser also served as a Juvenile Judge in Floyd County adjudicating cases involving minors and juvenile delinquents .
This helped Prosser form his opinions on the needs of youth.While superintendent , Prosser met many boys who were most interested in working with their hands to make things and only wanted to learn a trade .
Prosser began to think that schools should help train boys for trades with the help of a Ph.D. .
He would not return to the superintendency at New Albany.Dr .
Prosser later began to work with other organizations including employment as the superintendent of the Children 's Aid Society in New York City where evening industrial instruction classes were offered to the public .
He later became Deputy Commissioner of Industrial Education for Massachusetts from 1910 to 1912 , and then Secretary of the National Society for the Promotion of Industrial Education again in New York City from 1912 to 1915 .
While Prosser was Secretary of the National Society , he traveled widely forming and enthusing many individuals and groups .
Prosser suggested programs and standards that helped to pass legislation that showed the entire Nation the possibilities of public vocational education .
He also served as the first executive director of the Federal Board for Vocational Education from 1917 to 1919 .
Prosser also reported to congress numerous times with his mentor David Snedden .
On February 23 , 1917 , President Wilson signed the Smith-Hughes Act into law , and federal funding for vocational education was established.Prosser finally moved to Minneapolis , where from 1915 to 1945 he headed the pioneering Dunwoody Industrial Institute ( now Dunwoody College of Technology ) , where many of today 's vocational training concepts were created.Prosser died in 1952 .
Prosser 's impact on vocational education Prosser was instrumental in the writing and passage of the Smith-Hughes Act that began federal spending for vocational education.Prosser believed that schools should help students " to get a job , to hold it , and to advance to a better one . "
He was critical of schools of the era because they focused more on scholarly works and college preparations rather than a focus on helping the students in getting real-world jobs and keeping them .
Prosser believed that knowledge could not be easily transferred from one field of learning to another , instead he believed in order to be effective that learning had to be specific and directed to immediate ends .
Attendees at Prosser 's colleges included Georg Kerschensteiner .
Prosser believed that there should be public vocational schools as an alternative to high schools , which would offer courses for each occupation available.It was Prosser 's work in Minneapolis that set the standards for modern Vocational Education .
Dr. Prosser was also an author of many textbooks on Vocational Education , many of which are still used in vocational schools today .
He would often collaborate with distinguished writers for bulletins and magazine articles around the nation.Prosser wanted to get a vocational education program in high schools because he believed everyone could benefit from vocational classes not just people going into vocational careers .
He believed that vocational classes in high schools would make the students more independent .
This was brought to his attention when he was working with some teenagers who had some behavioral problems .
He found out that this boys loved to do things with their hands and that is what was continuously getting them in trouble .
He then looked into getting vocational classes in high schools and realized that these classes would benefit all teenagers in their education development .

Hercules and Love Affair is the debut studio album by American electronic music band Hercules and Love Affair , released on March 10 , 2008 by DFA Records .
The album was produced by Andrew Butler and Tim Goldsworthy .
Andrew Raposo ( of fellow DFA band Automato ) and Tyler Pope ( of !!! )
contributed bass to the album , while Antony Hegarty co-wrote and performed vocals on select songs .
Music Most reviewers comment on the album 's musical style as an homage to or re-imagining of disco and classic house music .
Fact Magazine dubbed the album 's style " a pulsating , glamorous , elegiac mix of classic disco influences , live instrumentation and modernist , mind-spangling electronic production . "
Similarly , The Daily Telegraph critic Bernadette McNulty dubs the music " d-i-s-c-o in its seventies glory " into which " Butler weaves [ ... ] fractured Chicago house beats and pulsing synths , " going on to refer to the overall style of the album as " a tableau of beautiful , dysphoric disco visions . "
The Guardian also describes the music in the same terms , commenting " it sounds like proper late-70s disco .
Not the camp glitterball retro electro-pop of Kylie circa ' Spinning Round ' , but actual underground disco , like something long-lost from the vaults of The Loft or the Paradise Garage , real 1977 -- 78 vintage stuff . "
However , while most focus on the obvious musical debt to disco , some critics highlight the album 's eclectic range of styles , such as Eddy Lawrence , for whom the album " has dark , psychedelic moments , such as the downbeat , mildly menacing , almost Congotronic ' Easy ' alongside outright funky party stuff like ' You Belong ' . "
Butler himself describes the album 's musical approach thus : I always say it 's a rhythmic , artsy kind of pop music that was made with classic dance and electronic music in mind .
It has a lot of vocals and is rooted in my childhood.The album 's first single " Blind " , co-written and featuring vocals by Antony Hegarty , was released on March 3 , 2008 and reached number forty on the UK Singles Chart .
The NME called it a " stone-cold classic " , going on to describe it as " the best kind of dance record : physical and emotional , euphorically happy and deeply , irredeemably sad .
It clips along weightlessly ; all disco bass , trumpets and rippling synthesiser , as Antony , his voice like tears rolling down the cheeks of a beautiful 40-year-old woman , muses intoxicatingly on lost innocence and ageing . "
However , the magazine dismissed the song " You Belong " as " essentially just an old Chicago house tune given a digital spit 'n' polish . "
The music video for " Blind " was directed by London-based Saam and features English actress Jamie Winstone walking through clouds of smoke .
Pitchfork described the video as a " bacchanalian orgy tak [ ing ] place all around [ Winstone ] , hearkening back to the pre-AIDS days of disco and places like the Continental Baths , where Larry Levan DJed and which advertisers promoted as recalling ' the glory of ancient Rome ' . "
Critical reception Hercules and Love Affair received general acclaim from music critics .
At Metacritic , which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the album received an average score of 86 , based on 31 reviews , which indicates " universal acclaim " .
Fact magazine called it " a unique , deeply satisfying and insanely catchy piece of work . "
Dan Weiss of The Village Voice praised its " glorious funkscapes " .
Pitchfork 's Philip Sherburne awarded the album 9.1 / 10 , and described it as " Lush , melancholic , gregarious , generous , both precise and a little bit unhinged " before going on to proclaim " this is the most original American dance album in a long while . "
Pitchfork named " Blind " the best song of 2008 and placed it at number eighteen on the website 's list of The Top 500 Tracks of the 2000s , while the album itself was ranked number 132 on their list of the top 200 albums of the 2000s .
Paul Flynn of The Observer awarded the album a maximum five stars , commenting that it " concentrates on the musicality of the [ disco ] genre and leaves the cliches for dust , " adding " it is as sweaty , raw and meaningful as the first 12-inch singles that were spun at NY lofts . "
The Guardian critic Alexis Petridis was slightly more skeptical , finding the album 's first side to be " tremendous fun " , but - as a result of its being confined to genre revivalism - to possess " an air of pointlessness " .
However , he deemed the inclusion of Hegarty 's melancholic vocals in the disco setting to be " inspired , " and praised the album 's " far more inventive second half [ , as ] its atmosphere shifts from touchy-feely warmth to queasy unease to deep melancholy , as if the authors keep being jolted from their nostalgic musical reverie by the thought of how horribly it all ended .
